# Predicate Device Selection Guide

## What Makes a Valid Predicate?

A predicate device must be:
1. **Legally marketed** in the US (cleared, approved, or pre-amendments)
2. **Not subject to PMA** (i.e., Class I or II, or pre-amendments Class III)
3. **Has the same intended use** as your device
4. **Has same technological characteristics** OR different technology that doesn't raise new questions

## Predicate Strategies

### Single Predicate Strategy

**When to use:**
- Your device is very similar to an existing device
- Same intended use and technology
- Clear path to substantial equivalence

**Advantages:**
- Simplest review
- Clearest comparison
- Fastest clearance

**Example:**
> Device A (new pulse oximeter) cites Device B (cleared pulse oximeter)
> Same technology, same intended use, minor improvements

### Multiple Predicate Strategy

**When to use:**
- No single device covers all aspects
- Different features from different predicates
- Technology combines multiple approaches

**Considerations:**
- Must justify each predicate's relevance
- Combined predicates must cover entire device
- More complex review

**Example:**
> Device A (combination monitor) cites:
> - Device B for blood pressure measurement
> - Device C for pulse oximetry
> - Device D for temperature sensing

### Split Predicate Strategy

**When to use:**
- Intended use from one device
- Technological characteristics from another
- Neither device alone is sufficient

**Requirements:**
- Clear explanation of split
- Both predicates legally marketed
- Combination doesn't create new risks

**FDA pushback risk:** The 2014 SE guidance ("The 510(k) Program: Evaluating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications") explicitly discusses split predicates. FDA reviewers may request Additional Information (AI) letters if:
- The split seems to circumvent the SE standard (borrowing favorable characteristics from each)
- The combination of features from different predicates creates a novel risk profile
- The technological characteristics predicate has a fundamentally different intended use

**When split predicates are appropriate:**
- Well-established technology applied to a well-established clinical use, but no single device combines both
- Multi-function devices where each function has clear precedent
- Devices entering a market segment where technology and clinical application evolved separately

**When split predicates are risky:**
- FDA has previously expressed concern about splits in this device area
- The two predicates are in different product codes or review panels
- Combining the features introduces interactions not tested in either predicate

**Example:**
> Device A (new surgical tool) cites:
> - Device B for intended use (same surgical procedure)
> - Device C for technology (same mechanism of action)

### Reference Predicate (Different from Primary)

**When to use:**
- Primary predicate establishes equivalence
- Reference devices provide supporting data
- Comparison to state of the art

**Important:**
- Reference ≠ predicate for equivalence
- Reference supports safety/effectiveness claims
- Must clearly distinguish roles

## Predicate vs. Reference Device

| Aspect | Predicate | Reference |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Purpose | Establish substantial equivalence | Provide comparison data |
| Requirements | Same intended use | May have different use |
| Role in 510(k) | Mandatory comparison | Optional support |
| Regulatory status | Must be legally marketed | Should be marketed |
| Labeling impact | Defines your intended use | No direct impact |

## Choosing the Best Predicate

### Factors to Consider

1. **Recency**
   - Recent predicates preferred
   - Shows current state of technology
   - Less likely to be obsolete

2. **Similarity**
   - More similar = easier comparison
   - Same product code preferred
   - Same manufacturer helpful

3. **Clearance History**
   - Clean regulatory history
   - No recalls or safety issues
   - Well-documented decision

4. **Data Availability**
   - Public summary available
   - Performance data accessible
   - Testing standards known

### Red Flags in Predicate Selection

- **Recalled predicates**: Avoid if possible
- **Very old predicates**: May raise questions
- **Class III predicates**: Generally not valid
- **Foreign-only devices**: Not legally marketed in US
- **Pending devices**: Not yet cleared

## Special Situations

### Pre-Amendments Devices

Devices marketed before May 28, 1976:
- No 510(k) clearance number
- Still valid predicates
- Include grandfather devices

### De Novo Devices

Devices cleared through De Novo:
- Create new classification
- Valid predicates for future 510(k)s
- Check regulation number

### Combination Products

Products with drug/device/biologic:
- Complex predicate selection
- May need multiple pathways
- FDA combination office jurisdiction

## Common Predicate Issues

### Predicate Chain Length

Long chains (A→B→C→D→...→Z):
- Each link must be valid
- Technology may have evolved significantly
- FDA scrutinizes long chains

### Predicate Drift

When predicates are dissimilar:
- Current device very different from original
- "Substantial equivalence" questioned
- May need different pathway

### Missing Predicates

When no predicate exists:
- Consider De Novo pathway
- Check international clearances
- Evaluate Class III PMA

## Predicate Defensibility Scoring

When evaluating a predicate, assess these defensibility dimensions:

| Dimension | Strong | Moderate | Weak |
|-----------|--------|----------|------|
| Intended use match | Identical wording | Same clinical purpose, minor wording differences | Same general area, different specifics |
| Technology match | Same mechanism, same materials | Same mechanism, different materials or energy source | Different mechanism entirely |
| Product code | Same 3-letter code | Same review panel, different code | Different panel |
| Predicate age | < 5 years | 5-10 years | > 10 years |
| Regulatory history | Clean — no recalls, low MAUDE | Minor issues (Class II recall, moderate events) | Class I recall, death events, or withdrawn |
| Chain health | Direct predicate, short chain | 2-3 generation chain, stable | Long chain (5+), accumulated drift |

### FDA Reviewer Perspective

FDA reviewers evaluate predicate selection for:
1. **Intended use alignment** — Does the predicate's cleared IFU actually match your proposed IFU?
2. **Technological characteristics** — Are differences truly non-question-raising?
3. **Predicate validity** — Is the predicate currently legally marketed and not subject to enforcement?
4. **Chain drift** — Has the technology drifted significantly from the original predicate through successive 510(k)s?

**What triggers Additional Information (AI) requests on predicate choice:**
- Predicate is very old (>15 years) with no recent devices in the chain
- Predicate was recalled for a safety issue related to the technology being compared
- Subject device adds a feature not present in any predicate (may need separate justification)
- Intended use is broader than predicate's cleared IFU
- Split predicate where the combination creates new risk questions

### Predicate Drift

Predicate drift occurs when accumulated changes over generations create a device that differs significantly from the original predicate in the chain, even though each individual step was "substantially equivalent."

**Warning signs of drift:**
- Chain length > 5 generations
- Technology has changed fundamentally from chain origin (e.g., analog → digital)
- Materials have completely changed across generations
- Intended use has broadened significantly across chain
- Original predicate was cleared under different product code

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Use a recent predicate that is close to your device (skip back in chain)
- Show multiple predicates that bracket your device's characteristics
- Proactively address drift in your SE discussion
- Consider Pre-Sub to validate predicate strategy if drift is significant

### How Many Differences Are Too Many?

There is no fixed FDA rule. However:
- **1-2 differences** with clear justification: typically straightforward
- **3-4 differences** with performance data supporting each: usually acceptable if none are fundamental
- **5+ differences** or any fundamental change (mechanism, energy source, intended use): strongly consider Pre-Sub; may indicate wrong predicate or wrong pathway
- **Any difference raising "different questions of safety or effectiveness"**: per the SE standard in section 513(i), this may require a different predicate, additional clinical data, or a De Novo pathway

## Documentation Tips

1. **Cite specific K-numbers**: K240717, not "similar devices"
2. **Explain selection rationale**: Why this predicate?
3. **Address differences**: Acknowledge and justify every difference — do not minimize
4. **Provide comparison tables**: Side-by-side features with explicit same/different call-outs
5. **Include equivalence summary**: Clear substantial equivalence statement referencing 513(i)(1)(A)
6. **Address predicate health**: Note if predicate has clean regulatory history
7. **Pre-empt reviewer questions**: If you anticipate pushback on predicate choice, address it directly
