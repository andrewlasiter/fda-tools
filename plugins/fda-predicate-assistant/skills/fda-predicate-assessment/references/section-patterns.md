# Section Detection Patterns — Redirect

**Canonical source: `references/section-patterns.md` (plugin root)**

This file previously contained a separate copy. To prevent drift, all section detection patterns are now maintained in one location. See the canonical file for the full 3-tier detection system (Tier 1: Regex, Tier 2: OCR-Tolerant, Tier 3: LLM Semantic).
