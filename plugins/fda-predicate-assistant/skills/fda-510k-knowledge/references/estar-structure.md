# eSTAR Submission Structure Reference

## eSTAR Overview

The FDA's eSTAR (electronic Submission Template and Resource) organizes 510(k) submissions into standardized sections.

> **Mandatory filing requirement:** eSTAR is mandatory for all 510(k) submissions received on or after **October 1, 2023** (per section 3503 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023). Submissions not using eSTAR format will be refused.

### eSTAR Format
- eSTAR is a **fillable PDF form** (not a document template) — download from [FDA eSTAR page](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/how-study-and-market-your-device/electronic-submission-template-and-resource-estar)
- Current version: eSTAR 5.6+ (check FDA website for latest version)
- Attachments must follow naming conventions: `Section##_AttachmentName.pdf` (e.g., `Section06_DeviceDescription.pdf`)
- Maximum individual file size: 100 MB; use sequential numbering for multiple attachments per section
- All attached documents should be text-searchable PDF (not scanned images)

## Template Selection Matrix

Which eSTAR template to use for each submission type and device category:

| Template | Submission Types | Device Types | OMB Control Numbers |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|---------------------|
| nIVD eSTAR v6 | 510(k), De Novo, PMA | Non-IVD devices | 0910-0120, 0910-0844, 0910-0231 |
| IVD eSTAR v6 | 510(k), De Novo, PMA | In Vitro Diagnostic devices | 0910-0120, 0910-0844, 0910-0231 |
| PreSTAR v2 | Pre-Submissions, IDE, 513(g) | All device types | 0910-0756, 0910-0078, 0910-0511 |

**Decision logic:** Use nIVD for non-IVD devices, IVD for in vitro diagnostics, and PreSTAR for pre-submission meetings or IDE applications regardless of device type.

### Mandatory eSTAR Dates

| Submission Type | eSTAR Status | Effective Date | Authority |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| 510(k) | **Mandatory** | October 1, 2023 | 87 FR 57910 (Sept 22, 2022) |
| De Novo | **Mandatory** | October 1, 2025 | Final guidance |
| PMA / PMA Supplement | Voluntary | — | eSTAR accepted, not required |
| Pre-Submission (Q-Sub) | Voluntary | — | PreSTAR accepted, not required |
| IDE | Voluntary | — | PreSTAR accepted, not required |

### QMSR Alignment (February 2, 2026)

As of February 2, 2026, nIVD and IVD eSTAR templates (v6) align with the new Quality Management System Regulation (QMSR), which replaced the current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP/QSR) requirements. PMA applicants using older eSTAR versions should attach QMS documentation in the "Other Quality System Information" section. Download the latest template versions to ensure QMSR alignment.

### Technical Requirements

**Software:**
- **Adobe Acrobat Pro 2017 or later** (primary supported platform)
- 64-bit operating system recommended for performance with large eSTAR files
- Disable Protected Mode in Acrobat if experiencing slowness

**File Preparation:**
- Compress images to JPEG format to reduce file size
- Compress videos to AVC or HEVC MP4 format
- **Do not set PDF passwords** — passwords block FDA's redaction workflow
- Combine similar attachments into single PDFs with bookmarks and table of contents
- Built-in eSTAR forms replace separate FDA Forms 3881, 3514, and 510(k) Summary forms

**Downloading Templates:**
- **Right-click the download link → "Save Link As"** (browser-specific wording)
- Save the file before opening in Acrobat — eSTAR PDFs cannot be opened directly in web browsers
- Download URLs:
  - nIVD eSTAR v6: `fda.gov/media/174458/download`
  - IVD eSTAR v6: `fda.gov/media/174459/download`
  - PreSTAR v2: `fda.gov/media/169327/download`
  - FDA eSTAR guidance document: `fda.gov/media/152429/download`

**Early Technical Screening:** FDA performs Early Technical Screening on eSTAR submissions. If the eSTAR fails screening, a **180-day hold** is placed on the submission. Use `/fda:pre-check` to simulate FDA review before submitting.

**Submission Portal:** Submit completed eSTAR packages via the **CDRH Portal**: `https://ccp.fda.gov/prweb/PRAuth/app/default/extsso`. See `references/cdrh-portal.md` for portal details, file size limits, and submission procedures.

### Administrative Section
- **Accession Number**: Assigned by FDA upon receipt — leave blank in initial submission
- **FDA Tracking Number**: Auto-generated by FDA document control
- **Submission Type**: Traditional 510(k), Special 510(k), Abbreviated 510(k), or De Novo
- **Previous Submission Numbers**: Reference any prior related submissions (Pre-Sub Q-numbers, prior 510(k)s)
