# PCCP Guidance Reference

## FDA PCCP Guidance Overview

**Title**: "Marketing Submission Recommendations for a Predetermined Change Control Plan for Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-Enabled Device Software Functions"

**Status**: Final guidance (2023), updated with broader applicability (2025-2026)

## Key Concepts

### What is a PCCP?
A Predetermined Change Control Plan describes:
1. Specific planned modifications to a device
2. The methodology for implementing those modifications
3. How the modified device will be assessed

### When to Include a PCCP
- AI/ML devices with anticipated algorithm updates
- SaMD with planned feature additions
- Devices with iterative improvement cycles
- Any device where manufacturer anticipates changes post-clearance

### PCCP Elements

| Element | Description | FDA Expectation |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Modification Description | What changes are planned | Specific, bounded categories |
| Modification Protocol | How changes will be validated | Detailed V&V approach |
| Impact Assessment | How to determine if change is within scope | Clear decision criteria |

### Modification Categories (from guidance)

1. **Performance/specification changes** — Updated thresholds, ranges, criteria
2. **Input changes** — New data sources, sensor types, input formats
3. **Architecture/algorithm changes** — Model updates, retraining, new algorithms
4. **Clinical use changes** — Expanded populations, new anatomical sites
5. **Labeling changes** — Updated IFU, warnings, precautions

### Boundaries
PCCPs must clearly define what changes are NOT covered:
- Changes to intended use/indications
- Changes to device classification
- Changes requiring new clinical data
- Changes exceeding defined performance boundaries
