# Standards Tracking Reference

## FDA Recognized Consensus Standards

FDA maintains a database of recognized consensus standards at:
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm

Changes to recognized standards can affect:
- Testing requirements for your submission
- Predicate comparison validity (if predicate tested to older version)
- Guidance document applicability

## Monitor --watch-standards Usage

The `/fda:monitor --watch-standards` flag enables tracking of:

1. **FDA standard recognition updates**: New versions of recognized standards
2. **Standard withdrawals**: Standards no longer recognized by FDA
3. **Transition periods**: Time allowed to transition from old to new standard version
4. **Impact assessment**: Which project requirements are affected by standard changes
5. **Supersession detection**: Automatic comparison of cited standards against supersession database

### Check Method

```
WebSearch: site:fda.gov "recognized consensus standards" update {YYYY}
```

Cross-reference found standards against project's guidance_cache/standards_list.json to identify impacts. Also compare against the supersession database above for known edition changes.
