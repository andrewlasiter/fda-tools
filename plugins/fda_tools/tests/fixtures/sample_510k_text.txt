DEVICE INFORMATION
Trade Name: AcmeFix Spinal Fusion System
Common Name: Intervertebral Body Fusion Device
Classification: Product Code OVE
Regulation Number: 21 CFR 888.3080
Device Class: II

PREDICATE DEVICES
The subject device is substantially equivalent to the following predicate devices:
1. K192345 - SpineTech Fusion Device (SpineTech Corporation, cleared 03/15/2020)
2. K181234 - OrthoFuse System (OrthoFuse Inc., cleared 11/22/2019)

Additional reference devices cited in this submission:
- K170987 - BoneGraft Plus (BoneGraft Medical LLC, cleared 06/30/2018)
- P190001 - CardioValve Replacement System (not a predicate - cited for comparison only)

INDICATIONS FOR USE
The AcmeFix Spinal Fusion System is intended for use in skeletally mature patients for intervertebral body fusion of the lumbar spine (L2-S1) in conjunction with supplemental fixation. The device is intended to be used with autogenous bone graft.

DEVICE DESCRIPTION
The AcmeFix Spinal Fusion System is an intervertebral body fusion device made of PEEK (polyetheretherketone) with titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) endplates. The device is available in multiple sizes to accommodate varying disc heights and footprints.

The device operates on the principle of providing structural support and maintaining disc height while facilitating bony fusion across the treated vertebral segment.

SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE COMPARISON
The subject device has the same intended use as the predicate devices K192345 and K181234. Both are indicated for intervertebral body fusion of the lumbar spine.

Technological characteristics comparison:
- Material: Same (PEEK body with titanium endplates) as K192345
- Geometry: Similar lordotic angle range (0-12 degrees)
- Sizes: Comparable size range to both predicates
- Sterilization: Gamma radiation, same as predicates
- Shelf Life: 5 years, consistent with K192345

The differences between the subject device and predicates (slightly wider footprint range) do not raise new questions of safety or effectiveness.

PERFORMANCE TESTING
Testing performed includes:
1. Static compression testing per ASTM F2077
2. Static torsion testing per ASTM F2077
3. Subsidence testing per ASTM F2267
4. Fatigue testing per ASTM F2077
5. Biocompatibility testing per ISO 10993-1:2018 (cytotoxicity, sensitization, irritation)
6. Sterilization validation per ISO 11137
7. Shelf life testing per ASTM F1980 (accelerated aging)

All test results met acceptance criteria.

OTHER DEVICES MENTIONED
The submission also references DEN200045 (De Novo classification for a related interbody device), N0012 (a pre-amendments device), and notes that K241335 was recently cleared in the same product code.

SUPPLEMENT DEVICES
K192345/S001 was a supplement to the primary predicate adding a new size option.
K181234/S002 added a lordotic angle variant.

Note: Device K1O2345 appears to be a misprint of K102345 based on OCR analysis.
Device KI92345 appears to be a misprint of K192345.
