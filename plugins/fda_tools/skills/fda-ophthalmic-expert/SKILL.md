## Common Deficiency Patterns (Ophthalmic Devices)

### IOL Deficiencies

**#1 Most Common:** Glistening and long-term optical clarity not characterized
**Example:** "Glistening assessment only performed at 12 months. No data beyond 2 years."
**Fix:** Extend clinical study to 3 years minimum. Use Scheimpflug imaging with Miyata grading. Target ≤Grade 2.

**#2:** Refractive power accuracy insufficient
**Example:** "IOL labeled power measured ±0.75 D from nominal. ISO 11979-2 requires ±0.5 D for monofocal."
**Fix:** Tighten manufacturing tolerances. Increase sample size for power testing (n=10 per power). Use calibrated focimeter per ISO 11979-2.

**#3:** PCO rates not assessed or excessive
**Example:** "No posterior capsule opacification data beyond 12 months. Predicate showed 18% PCO at 2 years, subject device shows 35%."
**Fix:** Extend follow-up to 24 months minimum. Use EPCO 2000 or POCOman grading. Consider IOL edge redesign (sharp 360° edge). Compare YAG capsulotomy rates.

**#4:** UV/blue light transmittance not characterized
**Example:** "UV-blocking claim made without spectrophotometry data per ISO 11979-3."
**Fix:** Perform UV-A and UV-B transmittance testing (300-400 nm). Demonstrate <1% UV transmission. Document photopic transmittance >85%.

### Contact Lens Deficiencies

**#1 Most Common:** Oxygen transmissibility (Dk/t) inadequate for wearing schedule
**Example:** "Extended wear (30-day) contact lens has Dk/t = 95. FDA requires ≥125 for 30-day wear."
**Fix:** Either (1) reduce center thickness to increase Dk/t above 125, OR (2) change labeling to overnight wear (7-day, requiring Dk/t ≥87), OR (3) use higher Dk material.

**#2:** Corneal endothelial safety data missing
**Example:** "No ECD measurements in clinical study for high Dk/t extended wear lens."
**Fix:** Add specular microscopy at baseline, 3, 6, 12 months. Ensure <10% ECD loss at 6 months, <15% at 12 months. Assess hexagonality and polymegethism.

**#3:** Microbial keratitis rates excessive
**Example:** "Extended wear lens showed 4 cases of MK per 10,000 patient-years. Literature shows 2-3 cases for predicates."
**Fix:** Investigate root causes (compliance, care system, material). Consider additional microbiological testing. May require wear schedule modification or enhanced patient instructions.

**#4:** Biocompatibility testing incomplete
**Example:** "No cytotoxicity testing per ISO 10993-5 for new lens material formulation."
**Fix:** Conduct extract cytotoxicity testing using L929 mouse fibroblast cells. Perform direct contact testing if extract fails. Document extractables via GC-MS.

### Refractive Surgery Deficiencies

**#1 Most Common:** Refractive stability data missing
**Example:** "LASIK study terminated at 6 months. No data showing <0.50 D change from 3 to 12 months."
**Fix:** Extend study to 12 months minimum (24 months for hyperopic treatments). Show manifest refraction change <0.50 D from month 3 to month 12. Report regression rates.

**#2:** Glare and halo assessment inadequate
**Example:** "Patient complaints of glare documented but no validated questionnaire or objective testing."
**Fix:** Implement QoV questionnaire or NEI-RQL. Add contrast sensitivity testing under photopic and mesopic+glare conditions. Consider night driving simulation for multifocal/EDOF ablations.

**#3:** Predictability insufficient
**Example:** "Only 68% of eyes within ±0.50 D of target refraction. FDA expects ≥85% for excellent predictability."
**Fix:** Investigate sources of variability (nomogram, eye tracking, environmental). May need to (1) refine ablation algorithm, (2) improve eye tracking, (3) enhance patient selection criteria, or (4) adjust nomogram. Consider stratified analysis by attempted correction.

**#4:** Safety endpoints not met
**Example:** "3 eyes (2.1%) lost ≥2 lines BSCVA at 6 months. FDA expects <1%."
**Fix:** Investigate root causes (decentration, irregular astigmatism, haze, infection, ectasia). Enhanced screening (corneal topography, pachymetry, biomechanics). May require revision to inclusion/exclusion criteria.

### Corneal Implant Deficiencies

**#1 Most Common:** Corneal endothelial cell loss excessive
**Example:** "Phakic IOL showed 18% ECD loss at 12 months. FDA expects <15%."
**Fix:** Investigate design factors (vault distance, edge design, sizing). May require design modification to increase clearance from corneal endothelium. Consider lower risk patient population (younger, higher baseline ECD).

**#2:** Explantation/removal data incomplete
**Example:** "No data on ease of removal or corneal state after explantation for intracorneal ring segments."
**Fix:** Document explantation procedure in subset of patients. Assess corneal wound healing, scarring, refractive state post-removal. Demonstrate reversibility if claimed.

**#3:** Refractive outcome variability excessive
**Example:** "Corneal inlay for presbyopia: 60% within ±0.50 D. Insufficient predictability."
**Fix:** Stratify by baseline refraction, corneal parameters, age. Refine patient selection. Consider enhanced nomogram or sizing algorithm.

### Glaucoma Device Deficiencies

**#1 Most Common:** IOP control inadequacy
**Example:** "Mean IOP reduction only 18% at 12 months. Predicate achieved 28%."
**Fix:** Demonstrate non-inferiority if IOP reduction is lower. Consider combination with medications. Document long-term IOP control (≥24 months). Assess diurnal IOP curves.

**#2:** Complication rates excessive
**Example:** "Hypotony (IOP <5 mmHg) in 12% of patients at 3 months. Predicate showed 5%."
**Fix:** Investigate valve mechanism (opening pressure too low). Consider design modification. Enhanced surgical technique training. May require restriction to specific surgeon experience level.

**#3:** Tube erosion or exposure
**Example:** "6% tube erosion rate at 12 months. Required patch grafts."
**Fix:** Modify tube material or design. Enhanced surgical technique (patch graft at time of implantation). Long-term safety data required.

## Expert Tips

### For IOL Submissions (510(k) or PMA):
- **Glistening Risk:** Hydrophobic acrylic IOLs are prone to glistening. Require ≥3-year data with Miyata grading ≤2.
- **Multifocal/EDOF Complexity:** Glare/halo PROs are critical. Use validated questionnaires (QoV, Catquest-9SF). Expect longer review times.
- **Toric IOL Alignment:** Rotational stability data required (≤5° rotation at 3 months for ≥95% of eyes).
- **PCO Predictor:** Sharp posterior optic edge (360°) reduces PCO by 50-80%. Hydrophobic acrylic performs best.
- **Blue Light Filtering:** Controversial benefit. If claimed, document photopic transmittance >85% (avoid color distortion).

### For Contact Lens Submissions:
- **Dk/t is King:** Most common deficiency. Measure at -3.00 D power unless otherwise justified. Daily wear ≥24, overnight ≥87, extended ≥125.
- **Microbial Keratitis:** Extended wear lenses have 10-20× higher MK risk than daily wear. Expect rigorous microbiological testing and patient instructions.
- **Corneal Health Endpoints:** ECD, edema, limbal/bulbar redness, SPK are standard. Follow-up ≥6 months for overnight/extended wear.
- **Orthokeratology:** Requires overnight wear approval (Dk/t ≥87). Demonstrate refractive effect reversal. Enhanced MK risk management.
- **Scleral Lenses:** Growing category. Require conjunctival and corneal safety data. Vault clearance assessment critical.

### For Refractive Surgery Systems:
- **Predictability Thresholds:** Excellent ≥85% within ±0.5 D, Good ≥75%, Acceptable ≥65%. <65% likely needs design modification.
- **Safety is Non-Negotiable:** <1% BSCVA loss ≥2 lines. Single case of ≥3 line loss triggers SAE investigation.
- **Mesopic Vision Critical:** Multifocal/EDOF treatments must assess contrast sensitivity under mesopic+glare. Night driving issues are submission-blocking if severe.
- **Ectasia Screening:** Enhanced screening required (topography, pachymetry, biomechanics). Post-LASIK ectasia is a never event with proper screening.
- **Hyperopia Stability:** Hyperopic treatments less stable than myopic. Require 12-24 month data showing <0.50 D regression.

### For Corneal Implants:
- **Phakic IOL = High Risk:** Anterior chamber phakic IOLs have highest endothelial risk. Posterior chamber (ICL) safer but still requires rigorous ECD monitoring.
- **Reversibility Claims:** Must demonstrate removal procedure and post-removal corneal state (no permanent scarring or haze).
- **Intracorneal Rings (ICRS):** For keratoconus or post-LASIK ectasia. Require long-term stability data. Explantation procedure documented.
- **Corneal Inlays:** For presbyopia. FDA has been cautious due to corneal haze and endothelial safety concerns. ≥24-month data expected.

### For Ophthalmic Lasers:
- **Laser Safety Standards:** IEC 60601-2-22 (surgical lasers) and ISO 15004-2 (ophthalmic instruments). Eye safety paramount.
- **Eye Tracking Performance:** <10 ms latency, ±0.5 mm accuracy at 99% confidence. Automatic shut-off if tracking lost.
- **Ablation Accuracy:** PMMA ablation testing per ANSI Z80.11. ±5% depth accuracy for spherical corrections.
- **Femtosecond Lasers:** For flap creation (LASIK) or lenticule extraction (SMILE). Flap thickness accuracy ±10 µm critical.

**Input:** User developing silicone hydrogel contact lens for 30-day continuous wear. Asks about oxygen transmissibility requirements and corneal safety endpoints.

**Output:**
```

Device Summary:
- Device: ClearVision Continuous Wear 30 (silicone hydrogel, monthly replacement)
- Wearing schedule: 30-day continuous wear (sleep in lens, remove monthly)
- Material: Proprietary silicone hydrogel (water content 48%, Dk 140 Barrers)

Oxygen Transmissibility Assessment:
- FDA requirement for 30-day extended wear: Dk/t ≥125 (ISO 18369-4)
- Subject device Dk/t calculation:
  - Dk = 140 Barrers (measured per ISO 18369-4 coulometric method)
  - Center thickness at -3.00 D = 0.080 mm = 0.008 cm
  - Dk/t = 140 / 0.008 = 175 - COMPLIANT (exceeds 125 threshold)
- Comparison to predicates:
  - Predicate A (30-day): Dk/t = 175 (EQUIVALENT)
  - Predicate B (30-day): Dk/t = 138 (subject is SUPERIOR)

Corneal Endothelial Safety (CRITICAL for Extended Wear):
- FDA expects rigorous ECD monitoring for extended wear lenses
- Required time points: Baseline, 3, 6, 12 months minimum
- Current study design: N=200 eyes, 12-month follow-up (ADEQUATE sample size)
- Specular microscopy data:

- Bulbar redness: Grade 1.6 mean (ACCEPTABLE, <2.0)
- Superficial punctate keratitis: Grade 1.2 mean (ACCEPTABLE, <2.0 CCLRU)
- Corneal infiltrates: 3 events in 200 eyes = 1.5% (ACCEPTABLE, <2%)

Microbial Keratitis Risk (MAJOR CONCERN):
- Extended wear has 10-20× higher MK risk than daily wear
- Current study: 2 cases MK in 200 eyes × 1 year = 1% annual incidence
  - Rate: 10,000 per 10,000 patient-years = 100 cases per 10,000 py
  - CRITICAL CONCERN: Literature shows 20-30 cases per 10,000 py for modern extended wear
  - Subject device shows 3-5× higher MK rate than predicates
- Root cause investigation:
  - Compliance assessment: 68% removed lenses at 30 days (32% overwear)
  - Care system: Multipurpose solution compatibility not tested
  - Material: Surface deposits observed in 15% at 1 month
- FDA will likely request:
  1. Enhanced patient instructions emphasizing 30-day limit (not longer)
  2. Antimicrobial surface treatment evaluation
  3. Deposit resistance improvement
  4. Care system compatibility testing (ISO 18369-4 Section 9)

Biocompatibility:
- Cytotoxicity (ISO 10993-5): COMPLIANT (extract test, L929 cells, grade 0-1)
- Sensitization (ISO 10993-10): COMPLIANT (GPMT, no sensitization)
- Ocular irritation: NOT PERFORMED - ACCEPTABLE (cytotoxicity sufficient for contact lenses)

Deficiency Summary:
- CRITICAL:
  1. Microbial keratitis rate 3-5× higher than predicates (100 vs 20-30 per 10,000 py)
     - Action: Investigate root causes. Consider surface treatment, enhanced instructions, or wear schedule reduction to 7-day.
  2. Overwear compliance issue (32% exceeded 30-day limit)
     - Action: Enhanced labeling, patient education materials, wear schedule tracking card.

- MAJOR:
  1. 12-month ECD loss at upper limit (12.8%, threshold <15%)
     - Action: Extend study to 24 months to demonstrate no further decline. Stratify by age, baseline ECD.
  2. Deposit resistance suboptimal (15% at 1 month)
     - Action: Surface treatment evaluation. Care system compatibility testing per ISO 18369-4.
  3. No care system compatibility testing
     - Action: Test with 3+ multipurpose solutions. Demonstrate no adverse reactions (ISO 18369-4 Section 9).

- MINOR:
  1. Morning corneal edema 6.8% (acceptable but could be improved)
  2. No analysis of risk factors for MK (smoking, hygiene, demographics)

Recommended Actions:
1. STOP - Do not submit until MK rate investigated and addressed (CRITICAL)
   - Options: (A) Surface antimicrobial treatment, (B) Reduce to 7-day wear (Dk/t 175 exceeds requirement), (C) Enhanced patient selection/instructions
2. Implement care system compatibility testing (ISO 18369-4) - 8 weeks
3. Deposit resistance analysis (SEM, EDS, BCA assay) - 4 weeks
4. Root cause analysis for MK cases (patient interviews, microbiology, wear patterns) - 6 weeks
5. Consider 24-month ECD extension to de-risk borderline 12-month result - 12 additional months

Submission Readiness: 35/100 (NOT READY - critical safety concern)
- Oxygen transmissibility: 25/25 (excellent Dk/t = 175)
- Biocompatibility: 15/15 (complete)
- Corneal safety: 8/25 (ECD borderline, MK rate excessive)
- Clinical endpoints: 10/15 (adequate except MK)
- Labeling adequacy: 0/10 (not reviewed)

FDA Likely Response:
- HIGH PROBABILITY of Refuse to Accept (RTA) or major deficiency letter due to MK rate
- Expect request for comparative MK data, root cause investigation, and mitigation strategy
- May require design modification (surface treatment) or wear schedule change (7-day vs 30-day)

Timeline to Submission Readiness: 12-18 months (if wear schedule reduced or surface treatment added)

  - High myopia (>-6 to -12 D): 62% (ACCEPTABLE, high myopia typically lower)
  - Overall: 73% (GOOD)
- UCVA ≥20/40 at 12 months: 98% (EXCELLENT)

Safety Outcomes:

  - Root cause: Post-op haze (trace, resolved by 24 months with steroids)
- BSCVA loss ≥1 line: 3.2% (ACCEPTABLE, <5% target)
- BSCVA gain ≥1 line: 12% (POSITIVE - some patients gain quality)

Refractive Accuracy and Predictability:

- Mesopic CS with glare:
  - CRITICAL GAP: Not performed
  - Action: FDA expects mesopic+glare CS for LASIK systems. Recall subset (n=60) for testing.

Glare and Halo Assessment:
- PRO questionnaire: COMPLETE (NEI-RQL used - validated instrument)
- Symptom frequency (halos "often" or "always"):
  - 1 month: 22% (expected early post-op)
  - 6 months: 8% (ACCEPTABLE, <10%)
  - 12 months: 6% (EXCELLENT, <10%)
- Severity (severe/very severe halos):
  - 12 months: 3% (ACCEPTABLE, <5%)
- Night driving difficulty:

  - 12-month coma >0.3 µm: 6% of eyes (ACCEPTABLE, indicates good centration)
- Trefoil: Minimal change (GOOD)

Corneal Endothelial Safety:
- MAJOR GAP: No ECD data in clinical study
- Rationale: LASIK does not directly contact endothelium
- FDA perspective: Best practice to include ECD for complete safety profile

  - Tracking loss rate: 0.8% of procedures (ACCEPTABLE)
  - Automatic beam shut-off: <50 ms (EXCELLENT SAFETY)

Safety Interlocks:
- Fluence limiter: IMPLEMENTED (prevents >500 mJ/cm² per pulse)
- Emergency stop: IMPLEMENTED (68 ms beam termination, <100 ms requirement)
- Patient alignment verification: IMPLEMENTED (corneal vertex distance sensor)

Adverse Events:
- Serious adverse events (SAEs):
  - 1 case of interface keratitis (treated, resolved, no BSCVA loss) = 0.3%
  - 1 case of flap dislocation (repositioned day 1, no sequelae) = 0.3%
  - Total SAE rate: 0.6% (ACCEPTABLE for LASIK)
- Epithelial ingrowth: 1.4% (ACCEPTABLE, <5% typical)
- Diffuse lamellar keratitis (DLK): 2.1% (ACCEPTABLE, all Grade 1-2, resolved with steroids)
- Ectasia: 0% (EXCELLENT - screening criteria effective)

Deficiency Summary:
- CRITICAL: None (PMA-ready with minor improvements)

- MAJOR:
  1. Mesopic contrast sensitivity with glare not performed (FDA precedent expects this)
     - Action: Test subset of patients (n=60), add to Section 10 Clinical Data
  2. No ECD safety data (best practice for ophthalmic devices)
     - Action: Can be post-market study commitment OR test subset retrospectively

- MINOR:
  1. Mesopic CS decrease >0.3 log in 8% of eyes (borderline, <10% preferred)
     - No action needed, but document in labeling as expected finding
  2. High myopia predictability 76% (good but not excellent)
     - Consider nomogram refinement for >-8.0 D range in post-market

Recommended Next Steps:
1. Conduct mesopic+glare contrast sensitivity testing on subset (n=60) - 8 weeks (MAJOR)
2. Optional: Specular microscopy on subset (n=40) at 12-month visit - 4 weeks (MAJOR)
3. Finalize PMA labeling (indications, warnings, adverse events) - 6 weeks
4. Prepare PMA submission modules (Section 1-20 per FDA PMA guidance) - 12 weeks
5. Consider pre-PMA meeting with FDA (recommended for Class III) - 16 weeks lead time

Submission Readiness Score: 88/100 (NEARLY READY - excellent study)
- Optical performance: 23/25 (mesopic+glare gap)
- Clinical endpoints: 24/25 (excellent efficacy/safety)
- Safety profile: 24/25 (ECD gap minor for LASIK)
- Long-term data: 10/10 (24-month follow-up exceeds requirement)
- Labeling adequacy: 7/10 (draft reviewed, minor revisions needed)

PMA Approval Probability: HIGH (>80%)
- Strong efficacy data (85% within ±0.5 D)
- Excellent safety profile (0.3% BSCVA loss ≥2 lines)
- 24-month stability data (exceeds typical 12-month requirement)
- Advanced technology well-characterized (wavefront-guided, 6D eye tracking)
- Appropriate risk mitigation (ectasia screening, safety interlocks)

Expected FDA Review Timeline:
- PMA submission accepted (not RTA): 2-4 weeks
- FDA Day 100 letter: Request for mesopic+glare data, ECD discussion
- Applicant response: 8-12 weeks (complete testing)
- FDA Day 180 panel meeting scheduling (likely not required if minor deficiencies)
- Approval decision: 12-18 months from submission (standard PMA timeline)
- Expedited pathway unlikely (LASIK is well-established technology)

Post-Market Commitments (Likely FDA Requests):
1. 5-year post-approval study (annual UCVA, BSCVA, SAEs, n=200)
2. Surgeon training program (certification required for first 10 cases)
3. Enhanced ectasia screening in labeling (topography, pachymetry, biomechanics)
4. Annual adverse event summary to FDA
