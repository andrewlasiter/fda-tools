# Common strategic mistakes library
strategic_mistakes:
  pathway_selection:
    - Wrong pathway (510(k) when De Novo required)
    - Using recalled/withdrawn predicate
    - PMA when 510(k) sufficient
    - Ignoring device reclassification opportunities

  pre_submission:
    - Too many questions (>5) in Pre-Sub package
    - Vague questions without proposed approach
    - Skipping Pre-Sub and getting RTA
    - Wrong Pre-Sub type for question (Agreement for pathway question)

  rta_prevention:
    - Missing administrative elements (Form 3881, T&A statement)
    - Inadequate substantial equivalence discussion
    - Missing sterilization validation
    - Incomplete SE comparison table

  breakthrough:
    - Applying without preliminary clinical evidence
    - Non-life-threatening condition
    - Missing unmet need quantification
    - Weak KOL support letters

  advisory_committee:
    - Underestimating panel prep time
    - Ignoring FDA briefing document
    - Weak KOL testimonials
    - No mock panel rehearsal

# Decision trees and frameworks
decision_frameworks:
  pathway_selection:
    - Substantial equivalence assessment
    - Risk classification analysis
    - Predicate availability verification
    - Clinical data requirements
    - Rare disease population (<8K patients/year)

  pre_sub_strategy:
    - Pre-Sub type selection (Submission Issue vs Agreement)
    - Question formulation (proposed approach required)
    - Timing optimization (3-6 months before submission)
    - Supporting materials checklist

  rta_mitigation:
    - Administrative completeness (Page 1 review)
    - Technical completeness (substantive review)
    - Predicate verification (marketed, not recalled)
    - Performance testing adequacy

  breakthrough_eligibility:
    - Life-threatening/irreversibly debilitating disease
    - Breakthrough technology criteria (3 options)
    - Preliminary clinical evidence assessment
    - Unmet need justification
