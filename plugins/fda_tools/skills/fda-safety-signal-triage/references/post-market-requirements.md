# Post-Market Requirements Reference

## Overview

Once a device is cleared/authorized and commercially distributed, manufacturers have ongoing regulatory obligations. These requirements apply regardless of the premarket pathway used (510(k), De Novo, PMA).

## Medical Device Reporting (MDR) — 21 CFR 803

MDR requires manufacturers, importers, and device user facilities to report certain device-related adverse events to FDA.

### Who Must Report

| Reporter Type | Reports Deaths | Reports Serious Injuries | Reports Malfunctions |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Manufacturers | Yes — 30 calendar days | Yes — 30 calendar days | Yes — 30 calendar days |
| Importers | Yes — 30 calendar days | Yes — 30 calendar days | No (but may submit voluntarily) |
| Device User Facilities | Yes — 10 work days to FDA AND manufacturer | Yes — 10 work days to manufacturer | No |

### Reportable Events
- **Death**: Device may have caused or contributed to a death
- **Serious injury**: Device may have caused or contributed to a serious injury (life-threatening, permanent impairment, hospitalization, surgical intervention)
- **Malfunction**: Device malfunctioned and would be likely to cause or contribute to death or serious injury if it were to recur

### 5-Day Reports
Expedited (5 work day) reports required when:
- FDA has requested manufacturer submit 5-day reports for this device
- An event requires remedial action to prevent an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to public health
- An MDR reportable event for which FDA has not yet granted an exemption

### Supplemental Reports
Required within 1 month when the manufacturer obtains information that was not available at the time of the initial report.

## Corrections and Removals — 21 CFR 806

### Definitions
- **Correction**: Repair, modification, adjustment, relabeling, destruction, or inspection of a device without its physical removal from its point of use
- **Removal**: Physical removal of a device from its point of use to some other location for repair, modification, adjustment, relabeling, destruction, or inspection

### Reporting Requirements
- Reports must be submitted to FDA within **10 working days** of initiating a correction or removal
- Use FDA Form 3381 for reporting
- Corrections and removals not required to be reported: routine servicing, stock recovery for routine examination/testing

### Recall Classification
FDA classifies recalls by health risk severity:

| Class | Health Hazard | Example |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| Class I | Reasonable probability of serious adverse health consequences or death | Defective cardiac defibrillator |
| Class II | May cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences | Mislabeled blood glucose test strips |
| Class III | Not likely to cause adverse health consequences | Minor labeling error with no safety impact |

## Annual Registration and Listing — 21 CFR 807

### Establishment Registration
- All domestic and foreign manufacturers, repackers, relabelers, and specification developers must register annually
- Registration due: October 1 through December 31 each year
- Use FDA's Unified Registration and Listing System (FURLS)
- **Annual registration fee**: MDUFA establishment registration fee (verify current amount at fda.gov)

### Device Listing
- All commercially distributed devices must be listed with FDA
- Listing must be updated when adding new devices or discontinuing existing ones
- Listing includes device name, product code, proprietary name, and establishment information

## Post-Market Surveillance — 21 CFR 822

### 522 Orders
FDA can order post-market surveillance studies for devices that:
- Have been expected to have significant use in pediatric populations
- Are intended to be implanted for more than 1 year
- Are life-sustaining or life-supporting and used outside device user facilities

### Study Requirements
- Typically 36-month surveillance period
- Must submit a surveillance plan for FDA approval
- Interim reports at specified intervals
- Final report at study completion

## Unique Device Identification (UDI) — 21 CFR 830

- Devices must bear a UDI on their label (phased implementation by device class)
- UDI data must be submitted to FDA's Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID)
- Class III and implantable devices: full UDI compliance
- Class II devices: UDI required on label and packages
- Class I devices: UDI required on label and packages (some exemptions)

## Connection to PCCP

For devices authorized with a Predetermined Change Control Plan (PCCP):
- Changes made under PCCP authority must be documented
- Post-market monitoring data may be required per the PCCP's monitoring plan
- Adverse events related to PCCP-authorized changes must be reported per MDR requirements
- If post-market data suggests a PCCP-authorized change caused unexpected safety issues, the manufacturer must take corrective action

## Connection to Cybersecurity — Section 524B Postmarket Obligations

For cyber devices (devices with software that can connect to the internet):
- Monitor, identify, and address cybersecurity vulnerabilities in a reasonable time
- Maintain coordinated vulnerability disclosure processes
- Maintain SBOM accuracy as software components change
- Provide patches and updates for known vulnerabilities
- Report cybersecurity vulnerabilities that could cause serious adverse health consequences per MDR requirements

## Quality System Requirements — 21 CFR 820

Ongoing QMS obligations for manufacturers:
- Design controls maintenance (design changes documented)
- Production and process controls
- Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) system
- Complaint handling procedures
- Document and record controls
- Management review of quality system
- Internal audits
- Supplier controls

| Obligation | Deadline/Frequency | Citation |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| MDR death/serious injury report | 30 calendar days | 21 CFR 803 |
| MDR 5-day expedited report | 5 working days | 21 CFR 803 |
| Correction/removal report | 10 working days | 21 CFR 806 |
| Annual establishment registration | Oct 1 - Dec 31 annually | 21 CFR 807 |
| Device listing updates | When commercially distributing new device | 21 CFR 807 |
| 522 surveillance interim reports | Per approved plan | 21 CFR 822 |
| Cybersecurity vulnerability response | Reasonable time (statutory) | Section 524B |
| QMS management review | At defined intervals (at least annually) | 21 CFR 820 |
