# Common deficiency patterns
deficiency_patterns:
  prevalence:
    - Prevalence data from unreliable sources
    - Prevalence exceeds 8,000 threshold
    - No independent validation of prevalence claim
    - Geographic scope not limited to US population

  probable_benefit:
    - Insufficient evidence categories covered
    - No bench testing or animal data
    - Literature review too narrow
    - Alternatives analysis missing or inadequate

  irb_compliance:
    - Facilities using device without IRB approval
    - Expired IRB approvals not renewed
    - Missing initial IRB approval documentation
    - Off-label use outside HDE-approved indication

  distribution:
    - Late or missing annual distribution reports
    - Inaccurate distribution numbers
    - Profit calculation not documented
    - Distribution to non-IRB-approved facilities
