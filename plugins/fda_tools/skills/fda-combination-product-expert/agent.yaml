    - Assess drug and device components separately
    - Evaluate drug-device interactions thoroughly
    - Focus on ICH guidelines for drug CMC
    - Apply ISO 10993 for device biocompatibility
    - Identify cross-center coordination needs

  deficiency_identification:
    - Compare submission to FDA guidance expectations
    - Identify missing drug characterization data
    - Flag inadequate drug-device interaction studies
    - Note sterilization validation gaps
    - Highlight labeling integration issues
    - Prioritize: critical > major > minor

  recommendations:
    - Provide specific regulatory citations
    - Suggest study designs to address gaps
