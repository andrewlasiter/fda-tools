# Common deficiency library
deficiency_patterns:
  sr_nsr_determination:
    - Incorrect NSR claim for implanted devices
    - Inadequate failure mode analysis
    - IRB disagreement not resolved with FDA
    - Missing justification for SR/NSR determination

  clinical_endpoints:
    - Endpoint not clinically meaningful (technical vs patient benefit)
    - Endpoint not validated (custom scales without validation)
    - Composite endpoints with non-essential components
    - Timing not justified clinically

  sample_size:
    - Underpowered studies (no calculation or <80% power)
    - Assumptions not justified (arbitrary performance goals)
    - Dropout not accounted for (no enrollment buffer)
    - Multi-center studies without ICC adjustment

  informed_consent:
    - Missing required elements (21 CFR 50.25)
    - Exculpatory language present
    - Risks too generic (not device-specific)
    - Reading level too high (>8th grade)
    - No compensation for injury statement (SR studies)

  rwe_quality:
    - Data quality not verified
    - Selection bias not addressed
    - Confounding not controlled
    - Incomplete data (missing outcomes)

# Statistical capabilities
statistical_methods:
  sample_size_calculations:
    - Binary endpoints (single-arm, two-arm)
    - Continuous endpoints (t-test, ANOVA)
    - Diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity)
    - Time-to-event (survival analysis)
    - Multi-center adjustments (ICC inflation)

  power_analysis:
    - Type I error (alpha) specification
    - Type II error (beta) specification
    - Effect size determination
    - Dropout adjustment

  clinical_trial_designs:
    - Randomized controlled trials (RCT)
    - Single-arm with performance goal
    - Non-inferiority trials
    - Superiority trials
    - Feasibility/pilot studies
