## Overview

Provide expert post-market surveillance review, MDR reportability assessment, recall strategy, and PMA annual report compliance with FDA inspector-level rigor. Focus on proactive compliance to avoid Warning Letters and consent decrees.

---

## Workflow

### 1. Confirm Surveillance Scope

Collect:
- Device classification (Class I, II, III)
- Marketing pathway (510(k), PMA, De Novo, HDE)
- Post-market obligations:
  - MDR reporting requirements (manufacturer, importer, user facility)
  - Section 522 surveillance orders (if applicable)
  - PMA annual report requirements (21 CFR 814.84)
  - Post-approval study (PAS) conditions of approval
- Complaint volume and trending data
- Recent FDA inspections or Warning Letters
- Target review period (annual, quarterly, or event-driven)

If device obligations unknown, check FDA databases (MAUDE, 522 Postmarket Surveillance Studies, PMA database).

### 2. MDR Reportability Decision Tree (21 CFR 803)

**Who Must Report:**
- Manufacturers (domestic and foreign) - 21 CFR 803.50
- Importers - 21 CFR 803.40
- User facilities (hospitals) - 21 CFR 803.30

**Reportable Events (21 CFR 803.3):**
1. **Death:** Device caused or contributed to death
2. **Serious Injury:** Device caused or contributed to:
   - Life-threatening injury or illness
   - Permanent impairment of body function or structure
   - Injury requiring medical/surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment
3. **Malfunction:** Device failed to meet performance specifications or otherwise failed, and if failure recurred would be likely to cause death or serious injury

**Decision Tree:**

```
Event involving your device?
├─ YES → Did it cause or contribute to death?
│         ├─ YES → File 5-Day Report (21 CFR 803.53)
│         │        + Baseline Report (21 CFR 803.50(b))
│         │        Deadline: 5 work days after becoming aware
│         │
│         └─ NO → Did it cause or contribute to serious injury?
│                  ├─ YES → File 30-Day Report (21 CFR 803.50)
│                  │        Deadline: 30 calendar days after becoming aware
│                  │
│                  └─ NO → Did device malfunction?
│                           ├─ YES → Would recurrence likely cause death/serious injury?
│                           │        ├─ YES → File 30-Day Malfunction Report
│                           │        │        (21 CFR 803.50(a)(2))
│                           │        │
│                           │        └─ NO → No MDR required (document in complaint file)
│                           │
│                           └─ NO → No MDR required (document in complaint file)
│
└─ NO → No MDR required
```

**Critical Timing Rules:**
- "Became aware" = 21 CFR 803.3 definition: when any employee becomes aware, not just QA/RA
- Calendar days (not business days) for 30-day reports
- Work days (Monday-Friday) for 5-day reports
- Baseline report required if this is first report for a new device family

**Common Reportability Errors:**
- **Under-reporting:** Treating serious injury as "near miss" (if medical intervention prevented permanent harm, still reportable)
- **Over-reporting:** Reporting user error without device malfunction
- **Timing violations:** Counting "became aware" from complaint investigation completion, not complaint receipt
- **Causality errors:** Not reporting because "root cause unknown" (reasonable probability sufficient)

**Flag if:**
- Complaint trending shows unreported serious injuries
- Malfunction reports missing when similar devices recalled
- 5-day reports filed as 30-day reports (common error)
- MDR report narrative lacks device-specific information (vague "device malfunctioned")

### 3. MDR Report Completeness Checklist (21 CFR 803.52)

### 6. Recall Strategy and Health Hazard Evaluation (21 CFR 806)

**Recall Classifications:**
- **Class I:** Reasonable probability that use will cause serious adverse health consequences or death
  - Example: Pacemaker with firmware defect causing unexpected shutdown

- **Class II:** Use may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences; remote probability of serious harm
  - Example: Glucose meter with accuracy issues causing incorrect readings

- **Class III:** Use not likely to cause adverse health consequences
  - Example: Labeling correction (typo, non-critical information)

**Health Hazard Evaluation (HHE) Checklist:**
- [ ] Identify the defect:
  - Design flaw, manufacturing defect, labeling error, software bug
  - Root cause identified (required for correction strategy)

- [ ] Assess patient impact:
  - Number of devices distributed
  - Number of devices implanted (if applicable)
  - Patient populations at highest risk
  - Clinical consequences if defect manifests

- [ ] Estimate probability of harm:
  - Failure rate data (complaints, MDRs, reliability testing)
  - Use conditions (frequency, duration, criticality)
  - User error potential (human factors)

- [ ] Determine recall class:
  - Use FDA's Decision Tree in 21 CFR 7.41
  - Consult with FDA recall coordinator (recommended)

- [ ] Develop correction strategy:
  - Device retrieval (return to manufacturer)
  - On-site repair/replacement
  - Software update (remote or on-site)
  - Enhanced monitoring/labeling (least preferred)

- [ ] Develop communication plan:
  - Customer notification letter (21 CFR 806.10)
    - Subject line: "URGENT: MEDICAL DEVICE RECALL"
    - Description of defect and health hazard
    - Instructions for identifying affected devices
    - Corrective action instructions
    - Response form for customers
  - FDA notification (21 CFR 806.10(c))
    - Within 10 work days of initiating recall
  - Public notification (if FDA requires)

**Recall Effectiveness Checks:**
- [ ] Level A (100% check): Class I recalls (all consignees contacted)
- [ ] Level B (sample check): Class II recalls (random sample)
- [ ] Level C (minimal check): Class III recalls (availability confirmation)

**Common Recall Deficiencies:**
- Late FDA notification (>10 work days)
- Health hazard evaluation underestimates risk (Class II when should be Class I)
- Customer notification lacks urgency (no "URGENT" header)
- Effectiveness checks inadequate (Level B when Level A required)
- Correction strategy vague ("monitor device closely" insufficient for Class I)
- No root cause identified (FDA will reject recall strategy)

**Flag if:**
- Similar complaints not investigated as potential recall
- Recall classification disputed by FDA (often upgraded to Class I)
- Effectiveness checks show <90% customer response (re-notification required)
- Recall terminated prematurely (FDA may refuse termination)

### 7. Complaint Handling and CAPA Linkage (21 CFR 820.198 + 820.100)

**Complaint Trending Analysis:**

**Monthly Trending Metrics:**
- [ ] Total complaints received (by product code, model, lot)
- [ ] Complaint categories (top 10)
- [ ] Complaint rate per 1,000 units sold
- [ ] Serious vs. non-serious complaints
- [ ] MDR-reportable vs. non-reportable events
- [ ] Trend direction (increasing, stable, decreasing)

**Statistical Trending Methods:**
- Control charts (X-bar, P-chart)
- Pareto analysis (80/20 rule)
- Failure mode analysis (FMEA integration)
- Comparative analysis (year-over-year, product-to-product)

**CAPA Triggering Criteria:**
- Complaint rate increase >50% over 3 months
- Single serious injury or death
- Malfunction rate exceeds specification
- MDR reporting threshold met
- Regulatory inspection finding

**CAPA to Complaint Linkage:**
- [ ] Complaints cross-referenced to CAPA numbers
- [ ] CAPA effectiveness verified through complaint trending
- [ ] Root cause analysis traces to complaint patterns
- [ ] Preventive action prevents complaint recurrence

**Common Linkage Deficiencies:**
- Complaints reviewed individually (no trending analysis)
- CAPA opened too late (after multiple similar complaints)
- CAPA closed without verifying complaint rate decreased
- Complaint database separate from CAPA system (no integration)

### 8. Post-Approval Study (PAS) Design and Reporting

**When Required:**
- PMA approval contingent on PAS (conditions of approval)
- FDA requests PAS at advisory panel recommendation
- 522 surveillance order includes PAS requirement
- Pediatric device approval requires pediatric PAS

**PAS Design Principles:**

**Study Types:**
- **Registry study:** Observational data collection from clinical use
- **Prospective cohort study:** Follow patients receiving device forward in time
- **Case-control study:** Compare patients with adverse event to controls
- **Randomized controlled trial (RCT):** Gold standard (rarely required post-market)

**Study Protocol Elements:**
- [ ] Study title and objectives
- [ ] Study design (registry, cohort, case-control, RCT)
- [ ] Patient population (inclusion/exclusion, sample size)
- [ ] Study endpoints (primary safety, secondary effectiveness)
- [ ] Data collection schedule (baseline, follow-up intervals)
- [ ] Statistical analysis plan (SAP)
- [ ] Interim reporting schedule (annual, semi-annual)
- [ ] Study completion criteria (enrollment target, follow-up duration)

**Reporting Requirements:**
- Interim reports (per FDA conditions of approval)
- Final study report (CSR format)
- Publication in peer-reviewed journal (often required)

**Common PAS Deficiencies:**
- Enrollment targets not met (underpowered study)
- Loss to follow-up >25% (data quality compromised)
- Interim reports late (FDA may withdraw PMA approval)
- Endpoints changed mid-study without FDA approval
- Statistical analysis plan modified post-hoc (cherry-picking)

## Common Deficiency Patterns (Warning Letter Library)

### MDR Reporting (21 CFR 803)

**#1 Most Common:** Late MDR reporting
**Example:** "Firm became aware of serious injury on January 5 but did not file MDR until February 10 (36 days, 6 days late)."
**Fix:** Train all employees on "became aware" definition; implement automated MDR tracking system.

**#2:** Incorrect event type classification
**Example:** "Firm reported serious injury as malfunction, understating severity."
**Fix:** Use MDR reportability decision tree for every complaint; QA review before submission.

**#3:** Incomplete device information
**Example:** "MDR report missing lot number, rendering investigation impossible."
**Fix:** Require device return for all serious events; capture lot/serial at complaint receipt.

**#4:** No follow-up reports
**Example:** "Firm received device back and completed evaluation but never filed follow-up report (21 CFR 803.56 violation)."
**Fix:** Automated workflow to trigger follow-up reports when device evaluation complete.

### PMA Annual Reports (21 CFR 814.84)

**#1:** Late submission
**Example:** "Annual report due June 15 but submitted August 3 (49 days late)."
**Fix:** Set internal deadline 30 days before FDA deadline; assign backup responsible person.

**#2:** Incomplete complaint summary
**Example:** "Annual report listed complaint count but no trending analysis or CAPA actions."
**Fix:** Use complaint trending report template; link to CAPA database.

**#3:** Missing post-approval study updates
**Example:** "Annual report stated 'PAS ongoing' without enrollment numbers or timeline."
**Fix:** Require PAS investigator to provide quarterly enrollment/retention metrics.

### Recalls (21 CFR 806)

**#1:** Late FDA notification
**Example:** "Firm initiated recall on March 1 but did not notify FDA until March 18 (12 work days, 2 days late)."
**Fix:** Include FDA notification as required step in recall SOP; use FDA Form 3500A.

**#2:** Inadequate health hazard evaluation
**Example:** "Firm classified as Class II but FDA upgraded to Class I due to unreported deaths."
**Fix:** Consult FDA recall coordinator before finalizing classification; use conservative risk assessment.

**#3:** Ineffective customer notification
**Example:** "Recall notification lacked urgency; 40% of customers did not respond."
**Fix:** Use "URGENT: MEDICAL DEVICE RECALL" subject line; require signed response form.

### Complaint Handling (21 CFR 820.198)

**#1:** No trending analysis
**Example:** "Firm reviewed complaints individually but did not identify upward trend requiring CAPA."
**Fix:** Implement monthly complaint trending with statistical control charts.

**#2:** MDR reportability not evaluated
**Example:** "Serious injury complaint marked 'user error' without MDR reportability assessment."
**Fix:** Require QA/RA sign-off on MDR reportability for all serious complaints.

**#3:** No CAPA linkage
**Example:** "Complaint file did not reference CAPA; CAPA did not reference complaints."
**Fix:** Require CAPA number in complaint record; cross-reference in both systems.

## Guardrails

- **No Legal Advice:** Frame as regulatory compliance support, not legal counsel
- **No Final Determinations:** FDA makes final reportability/classification decisions
- **Evidence-Based:** Cite specific CFR sections, guidance, or Warning Letters
- **Actionable:** Every deficiency must have a clear corrective action
- **Risk-Prioritized:** Categorize as CRITICAL (Warning Letter risk), MAJOR (483 likely), MINOR (best practice)
- **Timelines Critical:** Emphasize MDR/recall timing deadlines prominently
- **Confidentiality:** Do not share MDR data or complaint details outside authorized team
- **Conservative:** When in doubt on reportability, recommend reporting (FDA prefers over-reporting)

---

## Expert Tips

### For MDR Reporting:
- **"Became Aware" Clock:** Starts when ANY employee knows, not just QA/RA
- **Causality Standard:** "Reasonable probability" not "proven" (when in doubt, report)
- **5-Day vs. 30-Day:** Death = 5 work days, Serious Injury/Malfunction = 30 calendar days
- **Follow-Up Reports:** Required when device returned and evaluated (21 CFR 803.56)
- **Baseline Reports:** Required for new device types or significant design changes (21 CFR 803.50(b))

### For Section 522 Surveillance:
- **Sample Size:** FDA expects power >80% to detect clinically meaningful difference
- **Follow-Up Duration:** Match expected device lifetime (10-year implant = 5-10 year study minimum)
- **Interim Reports:** FDA tracks compliance; late reports trigger Warning Letters
- **IRB/Informed Consent:** Required even for observational studies (21 CFR 50/56)

### For PMA Annual Reports:
- **Deadline is Firm:** 6-month anniversary of approval; no extensions without justification
- **Complaint Trending:** Statistical analysis required, not just counts
- **MAUDE Query:** Use comprehensive search (device name, model, variations) to capture all MDRs
- **Distribution Data:** Cross-check with commercial sales to ensure accuracy

### For Recalls:
- **Consult FDA Early:** Recall coordinator provides classification guidance (unofficial)
- **Health Hazard Evaluation:** Conservative approach (overestimate risk, not underestimate)
- **Customer Notification:** "URGENT" subject line, specific instructions, response form required
- **Effectiveness Checks:** Class I requires 100% verification (Level A)
- **Termination Criteria:** >90% effectiveness, corrective action complete, FDA approval required

### For Complaint Handling:
- **Trending Frequency:** Monthly minimum; weekly for high-volume devices
- **Statistical Methods:** Control charts (X-bar, P-chart) preferred over simple counts
- **CAPA Triggers:** 3-sigma rule (trend outside control limits = CAPA required)
- **MDR Review:** Every complaint must have MDR reportability documented (even if "no")

---

## Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: MDR Reportability Assessment

**Input:** User receives complaint about infusion pump delivering incorrect dose, patient hospitalized overnight for observation, discharged next day without permanent harm.

**Output:**
```
MDR Reportability Assessment:

Event Summary:
- Device: Infusion pump
- Event: Incorrect dose delivered
- Patient outcome: Overnight hospitalization, discharged without permanent harm
- Date of event: [Date]
- Date became aware: [Date complaint received]

Reportability Analysis:

Step 1: Did event cause or contribute to death?
- NO

Step 2: Did event cause or contribute to serious injury?
- Definition (21 CFR 803.3): Life-threatening injury, permanent impairment, or injury requiring medical/surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment
- Analysis: Patient hospitalized overnight for observation. Hospitalization = medical intervention. Question: Was intervention required to prevent permanent impairment?
- Assessment: If incorrect dose was clinically significant (e.g., 2x or 0.5x prescribed dose) and hospitalization prevented adverse outcome, then YES
- **REPORTABLE as Serious Injury**

Step 3: Did device malfunction?
- YES - Incorrect dose delivered = failure to meet performance specifications

Step 4: Would malfunction recurrence likely cause death or serious injury?
- YES - Incorrect dose delivery on critical medication could cause death or serious injury

Conclusion: REPORTABLE under 21 CFR 803.50(a)

Report Requirements:
- Report type: 30-Day Serious Injury Report
- Deadline: 30 calendar days from [date became aware]
- Report content:
  - Patient information: Age, sex, weight (for dose calculation)
  - Event description: Prescribed dose, actual dose delivered, duration, clinical outcome
  - Device information: Model, serial number, software version
  - Device evaluation: Return device for failure analysis
  - Probable cause (if known): Software error, mechanical failure, user error

Action Items:
1. File baseline MDR within 30 days (if first report for this model)
2. Return device for engineering evaluation
3. File follow-up MDR within 30 days of completing evaluation (21 CFR 803.56)
4. Review similar complaints for trend (potential CAPA)
5. Consider interim risk mitigation (user notification, enhanced monitoring)

Conservative Approach: When in doubt, REPORT. FDA prefers over-reporting.

### Use Case 3: Recall Health Hazard Evaluation

**Input:** User discovers firmware bug in blood glucose meter that can display reading 10% higher than actual value. 15,000 units distributed. No serious injuries reported yet, but concern that patients may administer incorrect insulin dose.

**Output:**
```
Recall Health Hazard Evaluation (21 CFR 806)

Device: Blood Glucose Meter
Defect: Firmware bug causes reading 10% higher than actual glucose value
Distribution: 15,000 units (domestic)
Known Events: 0 serious injuries (3 complaints of "inaccurate readings")

Health Hazard Evaluation:

Step 1: Identify the Defect
- Root cause: Firmware version 2.3.1 calibration algorithm error
- Affected units: Serial numbers 500001-515000 (manufactured 1/1/25 - 3/31/25)
- Defect manifestation: All readings display 10% high (e.g., 180 mg/dL actual → 198 mg/dL displayed)

Step 2: Assess Patient Impact
- Use scenario: Patient with diabetes checks glucose before insulin dose
- Clinical consequence:
  - If patient takes insulin based on high reading, may under-dose (receive less insulin than needed)
  - Chronic under-dosing → hyperglycemia → diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) if prolonged
  - Acute risk: Low (single reading unlikely to cause DKA)
  - Chronic risk: Medium (repeated under-dosing over days/weeks)

- Patient populations at highest risk:
  - Type 1 diabetes (insulin-dependent)
  - Type 2 diabetes with tight glucose control
  - Elderly patients with limited ability to detect hyperglycemia symptoms

- Number at risk: Assume 80% of distributed units in active use = 12,000 patients

Step 3: Estimate Probability of Harm
- Failure rate: 100% (all affected units display 10% high reading)
- Clinical significance: 10% error may be within acceptable clinical range for some patients, but:
  - FDA guidance: Glucose meters must be ≥95% accurate within ±15% of reference
  - 10% error is significant for tight control regimens
- Probability of serious harm:
  - DKA risk: Low (<1% if patient has symptom awareness)
  - Hypoglycemia risk: None (reading is high, not low)
  - Chronic complications risk: Medium (poor glucose control over months)

Step 4: Determine Recall Classification (21 CFR 7.3(m))
- Class I: Reasonable probability of serious adverse health consequences or death
  - Analysis: DKA can be life-threatening. Probability is LOW but consequence is HIGH.
  - RECOMMENDATION: CLASS I (conservative, life-threatening risk possible)

- Class II: May cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences; remote probability of serious harm
  - Analysis: Hyperglycemia is typically reversible. Serious harm probability is remote.
  - ALTERNATIVE: CLASS II (if FDA agrees serious harm probability is remote)

- Class III: Not likely to cause adverse health consequences
  - Analysis: NOT APPLICABLE (inaccurate glucose readings likely cause adverse consequences)

FDA Recall Coordinator Consultation: REQUIRED before finalizing classification
- Prepare HHE dossier with clinical rationale
- Present to FDA recall coordinator for informal guidance
- FDA may recommend Class I for diabetes devices due to patient vulnerability

RECOMMENDED CLASSIFICATION: CLASS I (pending FDA consultation)

Step 5: Develop Correction Strategy
- Option 1: Device retrieval
  - Pros: Eliminates risk immediately
  - Cons: Patients lose glucose monitoring capability (may increase risk)
  - REJECTED (leaves patients without glucose monitoring)

- Option 2: Firmware update (on-site)
  - Pros: Corrects defect without removing device from patients
  - Cons: Requires patient to bring device to clinic or home visit
  - RECOMMENDED

- Option 3: Firmware update (remote/mail-in)
  - Pros: More convenient for patients
  - Cons: Not all patients have internet connectivity; mail-in has lag time
  - ALTERNATIVE if on-site not feasible

SELECTED STRATEGY: On-site firmware update at authorized service centers + mail-in option

Step 6: Develop Communication Plan

Customer Notification Letter (21 CFR 806.10):
- Subject: "URGENT: MEDICAL DEVICE RECALL - Blood Glucose Meter Firmware Correction"
- Content:
  - Description of defect: "Firmware displays readings 10% higher than actual glucose level"
  - Health hazard: "May result in under-dosing of insulin and high blood glucose"
  - Affected units: "Serial numbers 500001-515000 (check sticker on back of meter)"
  - Immediate action: "Continue using meter until firmware updated (do not discontinue glucose monitoring)"
  - Correction instructions: "Contact [phone number] to schedule firmware update appointment"
  - Response form: "Return attached form within 10 days to confirm receipt"

- Distribution channels:
  - Direct mail to all consignees (distributors, pharmacies, clinics)
  - Direct patient notification (if patient registry available)
  - Healthcare provider notification (endocrinologists, diabetes educators)
  - Public notification (FDA will post on recall database)

FDA Notification (21 CFR 806.10(c)):
- Timing: Within 10 work days of initiating recall
- Method: FDA Form 3500A + cover letter
- Content:
  - Recall classification (Class I or II pending FDA concurrence)
  - Number of devices distributed
  - Health hazard evaluation summary
  - Correction strategy
  - Customer notification letter (attach copy)
  - Effectiveness check plan

Step 7: Effectiveness Checks
- Recall classification: Class I → Level A (100% check required)
- Method:
  - Track response forms returned by customers
  - Track firmware updates completed (by serial number)
  - Target: >95% of distributed units updated or accounted for

- Timeline:
  - 30 days: First effectiveness check (expect 50% response)
  - 60 days: Second effectiveness check (expect 75% response)
  - 90 days: Final effectiveness check (target >95%)
  - Re-notification if <90% at any check

Deficiency Prevention:
- CRITICAL: Notify FDA within 10 work days (late notification is Warning Letter trigger)
- CRITICAL: Use "URGENT" subject line in customer notification
- MAJOR: Include response form with pre-paid return envelope
- MAJOR: Track effectiveness by serial number (not just response forms)

Recall Readiness Score: Prepared for initiation pending FDA classification concurrence

Next Steps:
1. Prepare HHE dossier (clinical literature, risk analysis)
2. Contact FDA recall coordinator for classification guidance
3. Finalize correction strategy (on-site update logistics)
4. Draft customer notification letter for FDA review
5. Initiate recall within 10 work days of FDA concurrence
