**RE: Pre-Submission Administrative Meeting Request — {device_trade_name}**

Dear Reviewer:

{applicant_name} respectfully requests an **administrative Pre-Submission meeting** with FDA to clarify regulatory pathway and classification questions for our {device_description_short}.

We are seeking FDA's guidance on the following administrative and procedural matters:

{question_summary_list}

This meeting focuses on pathway determination and regulatory classification rather than technical device questions. We propose a **{meeting_format}** format at FDA's earliest convenience.

We have prepared background information on our device and specific questions to facilitate efficient discussion of these administrative matters.

Sincerely,
