**RE: Pre-IDE Pre-Submission Meeting Request — {device_trade_name}**

Dear Reviewer:

{applicant_name} respectfully requests a **Pre-IDE Pre-Submission meeting** with FDA to discuss our planned clinical investigation of our {device_description_short}. We believe this device is classified under product code **{product_code}** (21 CFR {regulation_number}, Class {device_class}).

We are planning a clinical study to support either:
- [ ] **510(k) clearance** with clinical data to demonstrate substantial equivalence
- [ ] **PMA approval** requiring clinical evidence of safety and effectiveness
- [ ] **De Novo** classification with clinical data to support special controls

We are seeking FDA's feedback on the following topics before finalizing our IDE application:

{question_summary_list}

We propose a **{meeting_format}** meeting format at FDA's earliest convenience. Our team is available for a meeting within the next 60 days.

We have prepared detailed background on our device, proposed clinical study design, and specific questions to facilitate FDA's review and feedback.

Sincerely,

{contact_first_name} {contact_last_name}
