**RE: Informational Pre-Submission Meeting Request — {device_trade_name}**

Dear Reviewer:

{applicant_name} respectfully requests an **informational meeting** with FDA to provide an overview of our {device_description_short}. We believe this device is classified under product code **{product_code}** (21 CFR {regulation_number}, Class {device_class}).

**Purpose of this meeting:** We seek to introduce our device technology to FDA and understand general regulatory expectations before developing our formal testing and submission strategy. We are not requesting specific FDA feedback or regulatory advice at this time.

We propose a **{meeting_format}** meeting format at FDA's earliest convenience. Our team is available within the next 60 days.

**Topics we plan to cover:**
- Device technology overview and principle of operation
- Proposed indications for use
- Initial predicate device considerations
- General regulatory pathway discussion
- Testing and development timeline

We understand that FDA will not provide binding regulatory advice during this informational meeting, and we will follow up with a formal Pre-Submission or Q-Sub when our development program is more defined.

Sincerely,

{contact_first_name} {contact_last_name}
