# Section 15: Combination Product Information

*This section is required for drug-device, device-biologic, or drug-device-biologic combination products per 21 CFR Part 3.*

---

## 15.1 Combination Product Classification

**Combination Product Type:** {combination_type}

**RHO (Responsible Health Organization):** {rho_assignment}

**RHO Assignment Rationale:**
{rho_rationale}

**Center Consultation Required:** {consultation_required}

---

## 15.2 Primary Mode of Action (PMOA)

**PMOA Determination:**

The primary mode of action of {device_name} is [SELECT: mechanical/structural/pharmacological/immunological/metabolic].

**Justification:**

[Describe why the device/drug/biologic component provides the primary therapeutic effect. Reference clinical data, mechanism studies, or published literature supporting PMOA determination.]

**Example for Drug-Device:**
> The primary mode of action is mechanical. The stent provides vessel scaffolding and prevents acute vessel closure. The drug component (paclitaxel) provides secondary anti-restenotic benefit by inhibiting smooth muscle cell proliferation. Without the stent, the drug alone would not achieve therapeutic effect.

## 15.3 Drug Component Specifications (if applicable)

### 15.3.1 Active Ingredient

**Chemical Name:** [e.g., Paclitaxel, USP]
**CAS Number:** [e.g., 33069-62-4]
**Molecular Formula:** [e.g., C47H51NO14]
**Molecular Weight:** [e.g., 853.9 g/mol]

### 15.3.2 Drug Concentration and Distribution

**Total Drug Load:** [e.g., 3.0 µg/mm² of stent surface area]
**Coating Formulation:** [polymer matrix composition]
**Distribution:** [uniform coating, reservoir-based, etc.]

### 15.3.3 Drug Release Profile

**Elution Kinetics:**
- 24 hours: [X%] released
- 7 days: [Y%] released
- 28 days: [Z%] released (complete elution)

**Testing Method:** [e.g., USP dissolution apparatus, HPLC quantitation]

### 15.3.4 Mechanism of Action

[Describe pharmacological mechanism. Example:]
> Paclitaxel binds to β-tubulin, stabilizing microtubules and preventing cell division. This inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation and neointimal hyperplasia, reducing the risk of restenosis.

### 15.3.5 Pharmacokinetics (if applicable)

**Systemic Absorption:**
- Cmax: [if measurable]
- Tmax: [if measurable]
- Local tissue concentration: [if measured]

[If systemic levels are below detection limit, state: "Systemic absorption is minimal; drug acts locally with negligible systemic exposure."]

## 15.4 Biologic Component Specifications (if applicable)

### 15.4.1 Biologic Source

**Source Material:** [e.g., Bovine pericardium, Human allograft tissue, Autologous cells]
**Donor Screening:** [if applicable - viral testing, disease screening]
**Tissue Processing:** [decellularization method, cross-linking, sterilization]

### 15.4.2 Biologic Characterization

**Composition:** [e.g., Type I collagen 95%, elastin 3%, GAGs 2%]
**Structure:** [pore size, fiber alignment, mechanical properties]
**Bioactivity:** [growth factor content, cell adhesion properties]

### 15.4.3 Immunogenicity and Safety

**Immunogenicity Risk:** [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH based on source and processing]

**Disease Transmission Risk Mitigation:**
- Donor screening per [standard]
- Viral inactivation per [standard]
- Sterility assurance level (SAL): [e.g., 10^-6]

---

## 15.5 Device-Drug/Biologic Interaction

### 15.5.1 Compatibility Testing

**Biocompatibility:** [ISO 10993 testing for drug-device or device-biologic interface]
- Cytotoxicity: [result]
- Sensitization: [result]
- Irritation: [result]

**Drug-Material Compatibility:** [if applicable]
- Drug stability in contact with device materials: [result]
- No degradation observed over [duration]

### 15.5.2 Performance Impact

**Device Performance with Drug/Biologic:**
[Describe how drug/biologic affects device performance. Example:]
> The drug coating does not adversely affect stent mechanical performance. Radial strength, recoil, and deliverability meet the same specifications as the uncoated platform.

---

## 15.6 Combination Product Shelf Life

**Drug/Biologic Stability:** [separate from device shelf life]
- Drug content assay at [timepoint]: [result]
- Drug release profile stability: [result]
- Biologic integrity: [result]

**Storage Conditions:** [temperature, humidity requirements for drug/biologic stability]

---

## 15.7 Regulatory Pathway and OCP Coordination

**Regulatory Pathway:** {regulatory_pathway}

**OCP Coordination:**
[If OCP Request for Designation (RFD) was submitted, reference RFD number and OCP determination letter. If not submitted, explain why RHO assignment is clear.]

**Center Consultation:**
[Describe consultation with {consultation_required} on drug/biologic component assessment.]

---

## 15.8 Combination Product Risk Analysis

[Address risks specific to combination product nature:]

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Drug/biologic component degradation | Shelf life testing, stability studies per ICH Q1A |
| Incomplete drug elution | Release profile validation, residual drug quantitation |
| Immunological reaction to biologic | Donor screening, processing validation, clinical follow-up |
| Drug-device interaction | Compatibility testing per ISO 10993 |

---

**Section 15 Completion Notes:**
- This section is MANDATORY for all combination products
- Consult 21 CFR Part 3 for RHO assignment
- Consider early OCP engagement (Pre-Pre-Sub or RFD) if PMOA is unclear
- Drug/biologic components require additional testing beyond standard device requirements
