# Common challenges and solutions
challenge_patterns:
  eu_mdr:
    - No equivalent device (clinical investigation required)
    - Notified Body capacity constraints (wait times 3-6 months)
    - MEDDEV 2.7/1 Rev 4 clinical evaluation gaps
    - PMCF plan requirements (all devices)
    - EUDAMED registration complexity

  mdsap:
    - DHF gaps (FDA 21 CFR 820.30 stricter than ISO 13485)
    - Design control nonconformities (most common major finding)
    - Multi-regulatory compliance (5 authorities simultaneously)
    - Unannounced surveillance audits (annual)

  global_predicate:
    - US predicate not marketed in EU (separate equivalence needed)
    - No equivalent device in EU (clinical investigation required)
    - Predicate recalled or enforcement action (select alternate)
    - Predicate manufacturer uncooperative (no technical data access)

  international_clinical_data:
    - FDA questions EU study endpoints (not aligned with US practice)
    - Follow-up duration insufficient (EU 12 months, FDA expects 24+ months)
    - Patient population not representative (demographics differ)
    - Japan/China require local clinical trials (limited international acceptance)

  multi_regional:
    - Sequential vs parallel submission timing
    - Resource allocation across markets
    - Clinical data harmonization (single study for multiple markets)
    - Language and labeling requirements (24 EU languages, Canada bilingual)

# Cultural and regulatory philosophy awareness
regulatory_philosophy:
  us_fda:
    - Innovation-focused (510(k) pathway for incremental improvements)
    - Risk-based review (Class I/II less stringent than III)
    - Post-market emphasis (483 observations, recalls, MDR)

  eu_mdr:
    - Precautionary principle (higher pre-market bar than US)
    - Clinical evaluation rigor (MEDDEV 2.7/1 Rev 4 equivalence strict)
    - Post-market surveillance (PMCF, PSUR mandatory)

  japan_pmda:
    - Consensus-driven (prior consultation essential)
    - Local clinical data preference (Japanese patient population)
    - Quality focus (manufacturing site inspections common)

  china_nmpa:
    - Local presence requirement (China representative or subsidiary)
    - Registration testing (domestic testing preferred)
    - Clinical trial requirements (stricter than US/EU for Class III)
