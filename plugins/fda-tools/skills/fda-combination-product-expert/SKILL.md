## Primary Mode of Action (PMOA) Analysis Workflow

### Step 1: Understand PMOA Definition
**Regulatory Basis:** 21 CFR 3.2(m)
- PMOA = mode of action providing the **most important therapeutic action** of the combination product
- NOT the most obvious, first, or primary in time
- Consider the **contribution to the overall therapeutic effect**

**Key Questions:**
1. What are the constituent parts? (drug, device, biologic)
2. What is the intended therapeutic effect?
3. What is the mode of action of each constituent part?
4. Which mode of action provides the **most important** contribution to the therapeutic effect?

### Step 2: Identify Constituent Parts
**Drug Component:**
- Active pharmaceutical ingredient(s)
- Excipients integral to drug function
- Coating or matrix for drug release

**Device Component:**
- Delivery mechanism (needle, catheter, pump)
- Structural support (stent scaffold, implant matrix)
- Control system (electronics, sensors)

**Biologic Component:**
- Cells, tissues, or cellular/tissue-based products
- Proteins, peptides (if not synthetic drug)

### Step 3: Characterize Therapeutic Contribution
**Scoring Matrix (for RFD submission):**

| Criterion | Drug Contribution | Device Contribution |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Efficacy Attribution** | % of therapeutic effect from drug action | % of therapeutic effect from device action |
| **Duration of Action** | How long drug effect persists | How long device effect persists |
| **Reversibility** | Drug effect reversible? | Device effect reversible? |
| **Clinical Endpoint** | Drug directly impacts primary endpoint? | Device directly impacts primary endpoint? |
| **Mechanism** | Pharmacological, immunological, metabolic | Physical, mechanical, structural |

**Example 1: Drug-Eluting Stent (DES)**
- **Intended Effect:** Prevent coronary artery restenosis
- **Drug (Antiproliferative):** Inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation (reduces neointimal hyperplasia)
- **Device (Stent Scaffold):** Provides mechanical scaffolding (prevents vessel recoil, maintains lumen)
- **PMOA Analysis:**
  - Bare-metal stents (BMS) provide ~70% restenosis reduction vs balloon alone
  - Drug (sirolimus, everolimus) provides additional 50-70% restenosis reduction vs BMS
  - **Conclusion:** Both contribute significantly, but drug effect is incremental and most important for preventing restenosis → **PMOA = DRUG** → Lead center = CDER

**Example 2: Prefilled Syringe with Epinephrine**
- **Intended Effect:** Emergency treatment of anaphylaxis
- **Drug (Epinephrine):** Alpha/beta adrenergic agonist (reverses bronchospasm, hypotension, urticaria)
- **Device (Autoinjector):** Enables rapid self-administration via intramuscular injection
- **PMOA Analysis:**
  - Epinephrine provides the **entire therapeutic effect** (life-saving bronchodilation, vasoconstriction)
  - Device facilitates **delivery** but does not contribute to therapeutic action
  - **Conclusion:** PMOA = DRUG → Lead center = CDER (or CBER if biologic)

**Example 3: Photodynamic Therapy System**
- **Intended Effect:** Ablation of dysplastic Barrett's esophagus
- **Drug (Photosensitizer):** Accumulates in dysplastic tissue
- **Device (Light Source):** Activates photosensitizer to generate reactive oxygen species
- **PMOA Analysis:**
  - Drug alone has no therapeutic effect without light activation
  - Device alone has no therapeutic effect without drug
  - **Synergistic action required** → PMOA indeterminate → FDA assigns lead center based on expertise (historically CDER for porfimer sodium + light)

### Step 4: Prepare RFD Submission (if needed)
**When to Submit RFD:**
- PMOA is unclear or disputed
- Novel combination product without clear precedent
- Sponsor disagrees with anticipated FDA assignment
- Seeking pre-submission clarity on regulatory pathway

**RFD Content (per 2019 Guidance):**
1. **Product Description:**
   - Constituent parts (drug, device, biologic)
   - How parts are combined (co-packaged, physically integrated, chemically bonded)
   - Intended use and indications
2. **PMOA Analysis:**
   - Mode of action of each constituent part
   - Supporting evidence (literature, nonclinical data, clinical data)
   - Attribution of therapeutic effect to each part
   - Conclusion on which mode of action is most important
3. **Recommendation:**
   - Proposed lead center (CDRH, CDER, CBER)
   - Rationale based on PMOA
4. **Supporting Data:**
   - Nonclinical studies (pharmacology, device performance)
   - Clinical data (if available)
   - Literature references

**FDA Response Timeline:**
- 60-day goal for RFD decision
- FDA may request additional information (clock stops)

### Step 5: Apply PMOA to Regulatory Strategy
**Lead Center Assignment Implications:**

| Lead Center | Primary Regulations | Submission Type | Review Expertise |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **CDER (drugs)** | 21 CFR 210/211, Part 314 (NDA), Part 320 | NDA, ANDA, 505(b)(2) | Pharmacology, toxicology, clinical medicine |
| **CDRH (devices)** | 21 CFR 820, Part 807 (510(k)), Part 814 (PMA) | 510(k), PMA, De Novo | Engineering, biocompatibility, clinical devices |
| **CBER (biologics)** | 21 CFR 600-680, Part 600 (biologics) | BLA | Immunology, cell therapy, gene therapy |

**Consultant Review (from non-lead center):**
- Lead center requests consultant review from other center(s)
- Consultant center reviews constituent part under their jurisdiction
- Example: DES (lead = CDER) → CDRH consults on stent scaffold device component

- Qualification = safety assessment (genotoxicity, general toxicity studies)

**Example: DES Polymer Degradation**
- **Polymer:** Poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) - bioresorbable coating
- **Degradation Pathway:** Hydrolysis → lactic acid (endogenous metabolite, GRAS)
- **Impurity Concerns:** Residual monomer (lactide), oligomers
- **Safety Justification:** Lactic acid safe at physiological levels; residual lactide <0.1% by GC

   - **Cumulative release:** Total % released at end of study
   - **Release kinetics modeling:** Zero-order, first-order, Higuchi, Korsmeyer-Peppas

**Example: Drug-Eluting Stent Release Profile**
- **Drug:** Everolimus (antiproliferative)
- **Polymer:** Poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) - non-erodible
- **Release Kinetics:**
  - Burst: 20% in first 24 hours (initial therapeutic dose)
  - Sustained: 80% released over 28 days (diffusion-controlled from polymer matrix)
  - Residual: <5% remaining at 90 days
- **Release Mechanism:** Diffusion through polymer matrix (Higuchi model)

### Step 3: Device Performance with Drug
**Study Design:**
- Assess whether drug component affects device functional performance
- Compare drug-loaded device vs control (no drug)

**Example Tests:**

| Device Type | Performance Test | With Drug | Without Drug |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Stent** | Radial strength (ASTM F2606) | ≥Same as bare-metal stent | N/A |
| **Stent** | Recoil (ASTM F2079) | ≤6% | N/A |

   - **Time Points:** Real-time stability time points (0, 3, 6, 12 months)
   - **Analysis:** Target analysis for extractables identified in Step 1
3. **Toxicological Assessment:**
   - Compare leachable levels to safety thresholds (Permissible Daily Exposure, PDE)
   - Qualification studies if leachable >safety concern threshold (SCT)

**Example: Prefilled Syringe E&L**

- **Extractables Identified:**
  - Silicone oligomers (from lubricant): 50 ppm
  - Bromine (from rubber): 2 ppm
  - Antioxidants (from rubber): 10 ppm
- **Leachables (12-month stability):**
  - Silicone oligomers: 5 ppm (PDE = 1500 µg/day, safe)
  - Bromine: <0.1 ppm (below detection limit)
- **Conclusion:** All leachables below safety concern threshold → no additional qualification needed

### Step 5: Compatibility and Stability
**Study Design:**

  - Particulate matter: 5 particles/mL >10 µm (USP <788>: ≤6000/container)
  - Rubber extractables: Silicone 2 ppm, antioxidants <1 ppm
- **Conclusion:** Compatible for 28-day in-use period

## Sterilization Impact on Drug Component

### Step 1: Sterilization Method Selection
**Common Methods for Combination Products:**

| Method | Mechanism | Advantages | Disadvantages | Drug Compatibility |
|--------|-----------|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Steam (Autoclave)** | Moist heat (121°C, 15 psi, 15 min) | Fast, economical, no residuals | High temperature, moisture | **Poor** for heat/moisture-sensitive drugs |
| **Ethylene Oxide (EtO)** | Alkylating gas (40-60°C, 12-24 hrs) | Low temperature, penetrates packaging | Toxic residuals, long cycle | **Good** for most drugs; need EtO residual testing |
| **Gamma Irradiation** | Ionizing radiation (25-50 kGy) | Room temp, no residuals, high penetration | Radiation damage to polymers/drugs | **Variable** - some drugs radiosensitive |
| **E-beam Irradiation** | Electron beam (25-50 kGy) | Fast, room temp, no residuals | Limited penetration depth | **Variable** - similar to gamma |
| **Aseptic Processing** | Sterile manufacturing (no terminal sterilization) | No drug degradation | Complex, validation-intensive, higher contamination risk | **Excellent** for sensitive drugs |

### Step 2: Assess Sterilization Impact on Drug
**Study Design:**
1. **Sterilization Validation (Worst-Case):**
   - Expose drug-loaded device to maximum sterilization conditions:
     - EtO: Maximum EtO concentration, humidity, temperature, exposure time
     - Gamma: Maximum dose (dose mapping + 10%)
   - Test drug potency, degradation products, physical properties post-sterilization
   - Replicates: n ≥ 3 lots
2. **Comparison to Non-Sterilized Control:**
   - Analyze drug content before vs after sterilization
   - Calculate % degradation
3. **Stability Post-Sterilization:**
   - Conduct ICH stability studies on sterilized product
   - Ensure shelf life not compromised

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Drug potency: ≥90% of pre-sterilization (or tighter based on clinical impact)
- Degradation products: Within ICH Q3B limits
- No new impurities >identification threshold (0.1%)

**Example 1: Paclitaxel-Coated Balloon (Gamma Sterilization)**
- **Pre-Sterilization Potency:** 100.2% of label claim
- **Post-Sterilization Potency (30 kGy gamma):** 96.8% of label claim
- **Degradation:** 3.4% loss (acceptable, within specification 90-110%)
- **New Impurities:** None detected >0.1%
- **Conclusion:** Gamma sterilization compatible

**Example 2: Monoclonal Antibody Prefilled Syringe (Aseptic Processing)**
- **Drug:** Adalimumab (anti-TNF antibody)
- **Sterilization:** Aseptic fill (no terminal sterilization - protein would denature)
- **Process:**
  - Bulk drug solution sterile-filtered (0.22 µm)
  - Filled into pre-sterilized syringes (gamma-sterilized) in Class 100 cleanroom
  - Media fill validation: 0/3000 contamination rate
- **Conclusion:** Aseptic processing required for biologics

### Step 3: Sterilization Residuals Testing
**For EtO Sterilization:**
- **Regulatory Basis:** ISO 10993-7 (Ethylene oxide sterilization residuals)
- **Residuals to Test:**
  - Ethylene oxide (EtO): ≤10 ppm (devices in prolonged contact)
  - Ethylene chlorohydrin (ECH): ≤250 ppm
  - Ethylene glycol (EG): ≤250 ppm
- **Method:** Gas chromatography (GC) headspace analysis
- **Aeration:** Post-sterilization aeration to reduce residuals (5-14 days at 40-60°C)

**Example: Drug-Eluting Stent (EtO Sterilization)**
- **EtO Cycle:** 600 mg/L EtO, 60°C, 12 hours
- **Aeration:** 7 days at 50°C
- **Residuals (post-aeration):**
  - EtO: 3.2 ppm (limit: ≤10 ppm)
  - ECH: 12 ppm (limit: ≤250 ppm)
  - EG: 45 ppm (limit: ≤250 ppm)
- **Conclusion:** Meets ISO 10993-7 limits

## Cross-Center Coordination Strategy

### Step 1: Identify Lead Center
**Based on PMOA Analysis:**
- PMOA = Drug → Lead center = CDER (or CBER if biologic)
- PMOA = Device → Lead center = CDRH
- PMOA indeterminate → FDA assigns based on expertise, product history

### Step 2: Request Consultant Review
**Lead Center Responsibilities:**
- Primary review and decision authority
- Coordinate with consultant center(s)
- Issue final approval letter

**Consultant Center Responsibilities:**
- Review constituent part under their jurisdiction
- Provide recommendations to lead center
- No independent approval authority

**Example: Drug-Eluting Stent (DES)**
- **Lead Center:** CDER (Division of Cardiology and Nephrology)
  - Reviews drug component (sirolimus, everolimus, paclitaxel)
  - Drug characterization, pharmacology, toxicology, clinical pharmacology
- **Consultant Center:** CDRH (Division of Cardiovascular Devices)
  - Reviews device component (stent scaffold, delivery system)
  - Device performance (radial strength, recoil, deliverability)
  - Biocompatibility (ISO 10993)

### Step 3: Coordinate Pre-Submission Meetings
**Purpose:**
- Clarify regulatory pathway (NDA, BLA, PMA, 510(k))
- Discuss PMOA and lead center assignment
- Align on testing requirements (drug, device, integrated)
- Identify areas requiring consultant review

**Meeting Participants:**
- Sponsor team (regulatory, drug CMC, device engineering, clinical)
- Lead center reviewers (drug or device)
- Consultant center reviewers (if needed)
- OCP (Office of Combination Products) - for complex designation issues

**Pre-Submission Package (Submit 60 Days Before Meeting):**
1. Product description (drug + device components)
2. Indications for use
3. PMOA analysis and proposed lead center
4. Development plan (nonclinical, clinical)
5. Specific questions for FDA

### Step 4: Manage Parallel Reviews
**Submission Coordination:**
- Lead center receives complete application (NDA, BLA, PMA)
- Lead center sends relevant sections to consultant center
- Consultant center reviews constituent part, provides input

**Review Timeline:**
- **NDA/BLA (drug-led):** 10-month review (standard) or 6-month (priority)
  - CDER/CBER reviews drug component (Modules 2-5 of CTD)
  - CDRH consults on device component (device description, performance, biocompatibility)
- **PMA (device-led):** 180-day review goal
  - CDRH reviews device component (engineering, biocompatibility, clinical)
  - CDER/CBER consults on drug component (drug characterization, stability, pharmacology)

**Communication Strategy:**
- Lead center issues all communications to sponsor (information requests, deficiency letters, approval)
- Consultant center inputs incorporated into lead center communications
- Sponsor responds to lead center (cc consultant center if requested)

### Step 5: Handle Disagreements Between Centers
**Escalation Path:**
1. **Working Level:** Reviewers from lead and consultant centers discuss
2. **Supervisory Level:** Division directors from both centers convene
3. **OCP Mediation:** Office of Combination Products facilitates resolution
4. **Formal Dispute Resolution:** 21 CFR 4.101 (rarely used)

**Example: Disagreement on Clinical Trial Design**
- **Scenario:** Drug-eluting stent; CDER wants longer follow-up (5 years), CDRH says 1 year sufficient based on device precedent
- **Resolution:**
  - OCP convenes meeting with CDER and CDRH
  - Compromise: 1-year primary endpoint (device standard), 5-year safety follow-up (drug standard)
  - Documented in meeting minutes, binding on both centers

  - Crossover, n=60 healthy volunteers
  - 50 µg/hr patch, 72-hour wear
  - PK: Cmax 1.0 ng/mL (matrix) vs 1.05 ng/mL (reservoir), AUC 52 ng·hr/mL vs 54 ng·hr/mL
  - Bioequivalence: 90% CI within 80-125% (acceptable)

**8. Labeling (Key Sections):**
- **Black Box Warning:**
  - **Addiction, Abuse, Misuse:** Risk of opioid addiction even at therapeutic doses
  - **Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression:** Greatest risk during initiation (first 24-72 hrs)
  - **Accidental Exposure:** Fatal in children (dispose of used patches immediately; fold sticky sides together)
  - **Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome:** Prolonged use during pregnancy → withdrawal in newborn
  - **CYP3A4 Interaction:** Concomitant use with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, ritonavir) → increased fentanyl exposure → fatal overdose

- **Contraindications:** Opioid non-tolerant patients, acute/postoperative pain, mild pain, PRN use
- **Dosage:**
  - Initial: 25 µg/hr (if opioid-tolerant; 12 µg/hr if converting from <60 mg oral morphine/day)
  - Titration: Increase by 12-25 µg/hr every 72 hours based on pain control
  - Application: Apply to flat, non-irritated skin (chest, back, upper arm), change every 72 hours, rotate sites
- **Warnings:**
  - **Heat exposure:** Fever, hot tubs, saunas, heating pads → increased absorption → overdose risk
  - **Disposal:** Fold used patch, flush down toilet (FDA-approved method for fentanyl patches due to abuse potential)
- **Storage:** 20-25°C, keep in sealed pouch until use, keep out of reach of children

**9. Common Deficiency Pattern Addressed:**
- **Deficiency (2003 reformulation submission):** "In vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) not demonstrated"
  - **Response:** Conducted IVRT on batches with varying release rates (80%, 100%, 120% of target), correlated with clinical PK (Cmax, AUC). Established Level A IVIVC (linear correlation, r²=0.95)
- **Deficiency:** "Adhesion failure rate 5% (acceptance: <3%)"
  - **Response:** Reformulated overlay adhesive (increased silicone content 15% → 20%), re-validated adhesion (2.5% failure in clinical study)

**Outcome:** Approved 2005 (reformulated matrix design). Generic versions approved 2012+. Subject of FDA safety communications (2007, 2012) due to misuse/overdose → REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) required for all long-acting opioids (2012).
