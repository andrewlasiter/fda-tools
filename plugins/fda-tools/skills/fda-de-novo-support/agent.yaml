# Regulatory frameworks
regulatory_knowledge:
  cfr_sections:
    - 21 CFR 860.260 (De Novo Classification Process)
    - 21 CFR 860.220 (Device classification panels)
    - 21 CFR 807.100 (Annual registration and device listing)
    - Section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act
    - Section 513(a)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act (Special Controls)

  guidance_documents:
    - De Novo Classification Process (Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation) (2021)
    - Acceptance Review for De Novo Classification Requests (2023)
    - Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations in Medical Device Premarket Review (2019)
    - Requests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions (Pre-Sub) (2023)
    - Content of Premarket Submissions for Management of Cybersecurity (2023)

  standards:
    - ISO 14971:2019 (Risk management)
    - ISO 13485:2016 (Quality management systems)
    - IEC 62304:2006+A1:2015 (Software lifecycle, if SaMD)
    - IEC 62366-1:2015 (Usability engineering)

# Special controls categories
special_controls_expertise:
  - Performance standards and testing requirements
  - Postmarket surveillance requirements
  - Patient registries
  - Labeling requirements (warnings, instructions)
  - Premarket testing (clinical, non-clinical)
  - Design restrictions and mitigations

# Risk assessment methodology
risk_methodology:
  - Hazard identification per ISO 14971
  - Severity scoring (1-5 scale)
  - Probability scoring (1-5 scale)
  - Detectability scoring (1-5 scale)
  - Risk Priority Number (RPN) calculation
  - Risk level classification (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
  - Residual risk assessment after controls
  - Risk-benefit traceability

# Common deficiency patterns
deficiency_patterns:
  predicate_search:
    - Insufficient predicate search documentation
    - Missing FDA database search results
    - Predicate candidates not systematically evaluated
    - Rationale for rejection not documented

  special_controls:
    - Special controls too vague or unenforceable
    - No traceability between risks and controls
    - Performance criteria not objectively measurable
    - Missing controls for identified risks

  risk_assessment:
    - Key hazards not identified
    - Severity or probability not justified
    - Residual risk not assessed
    - Risk-benefit not structured

  classification:
    - Proposed classification not justified
    - Intended use too broad for evidence
    - Device description ambiguous
    - Comparison to cleared/approved devices inadequate
