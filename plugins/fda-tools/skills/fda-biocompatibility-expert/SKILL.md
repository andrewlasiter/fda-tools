Collect:
- Device name, class (I, II, III), and intended use
- Patient contact type:
  - Surface (skin, mucosal membrane, breached/compromised surface)
  - External communicating (blood path indirect, tissue/bone/dentin communicating, circulating blood)
  - Implant (tissue/bone, blood)
- Contact duration:
  - Category A: Limited (<24 hours)
  - Category B: Prolonged (24 hours to 30 days)
  - Category C: Permanent (>30 days)
- Materials of construction (all patient-contacting materials):
  - Polymers (material grade, manufacturer, additives, colorants, sterilization residuals)
  - Metals (alloy composition, surface treatments, coatings)
  - Ceramics (material type, porosity, sintering process)
  - Degradable materials (degradation mechanism, byproducts)
  - Coatings (drug-eluting, antimicrobial, hydrophilic)
- Manufacturing processes (extrusion, molding, machining, welding, cleaning)
- Sterilization method (EO, gamma, e-beam, steam, no sterilization)
- Submission type (510(k), PMA, De Novo, or pre-submission)

If contact type/duration unknown, request labeling draft or Instructions for Use (IFU).

### 2. Establish Biocompatibility Test Matrix per ISO 10993-1:2018

**ISO 10993-1 Framework:**

Test matrix based on contact type × duration × biological effect endpoints.

**Step 2.1: Determine Required Biological Effect Endpoints**

Use ISO 10993-1 Table A.1 decision matrix:

| Biological Effect | Surface Device | External Communicating | Implant |
|-------------------|----------------|------------------------|---------|
| Cytotoxicity | All durations | All durations | All durations |
| Sensitization | All durations | All durations | All durations |
| Irritation/Intracutaneous reactivity | All durations | All durations | All durations |
| Systemic toxicity (acute) | A, B, C | A, B, C | A, B, C |
| Subacute/Subchronic toxicity | B, C | B, C | B, C |
| Genotoxicity | B, C | B, C | B, C |
| Implantation | N/A | N/A | All durations |
| Hemocompatibility | N/A | Blood contact only | Blood contact only |
| Chronic toxicity | C only | C only | C only |
| Carcinogenicity | N/A | N/A | C only (permanent implants) |
| Reproductive/Developmental toxicity | Special cases (hormonal devices, long-term exposure) | Special cases | Special cases |
| Biodegradation | N/A | Degradable materials only | Degradable materials only |

**Step 2.2: Generate Device-Specific Test Matrix**

Example for permanent implant (Category C):
- ✅ Cytotoxicity (ISO 10993-5) - REQUIRED
- ✅ Sensitization (ISO 10993-10) - REQUIRED
- ✅ Irritation/Intracutaneous reactivity (ISO 10993-10) - REQUIRED
- ✅ Systemic toxicity - acute (ISO 10993-11) - REQUIRED
- ✅ Subchronic toxicity (ISO 10993-11) - REQUIRED for Category C
- ✅ Genotoxicity (ISO 10993-3) - REQUIRED (Ames, chromosomal aberration, micronucleus)
- ✅ Implantation (ISO 10993-6) - REQUIRED for implants
- ✅ Hemocompatibility (ISO 10993-4) - IF blood contact (thrombogenicity, hemolysis, complement)
- ✅ Chronic toxicity (ISO 10993-11) - REQUIRED for Category C (typically 90-day study)
- ✅ Carcinogenicity (ISO 10993-3) - REQUIRED for permanent implants (>30 days)
- ❓ Reproductive/developmental toxicity (ISO 10993-3) - IF device affects reproductive organs or long-term systemic exposure
- ❓ Biodegradation (ISO 10993-9, -13, -14, -15, -16) - IF degradable material

**Step 2.3: Document Test Matrix Rationale**

For each endpoint:
- **REQUIRED:** Cite ISO 10993-1 Table A.1
- **NOT REQUIRED:** Justify why (e.g., "No blood contact, hemocompatibility not applicable")
- **WAIVED via Historical Data:** Justify material equivalence (see Section 3)

**Flag if:**
- Test matrix missing carcinogenicity for permanent implant (>30 days)
- Hemocompatibility not addressed for blood-contacting device
- Genotoxicity missing for prolonged/permanent contact (Category B/C)
- Sensitization not tested for skin-contacting device
- Chronic toxicity missing for Category C device

### 3. Material Characterization and Chemical Identity per ISO 10993-18

**Objective:** Establish chemical identity of patient-contacting materials to support:
1. Historical data use (material equivalence demonstration)
2. Chemical characterization for risk assessment (extractables/leachables)
3. Regulatory compliance (material grade, specifications)

**Step 3.1: Collect Material Data Sheets**

For each patient-contacting material:
- Material name and grade (e.g., "Pebax® 7233 SA 01 MED")
- Manufacturer and supplier
- Chemical composition (polymer type, alloy composition)
- Additives (plasticizers, stabilizers, colorants, lubricants)
- Processing aids (solvents, catalysts, curing agents)
- Sterilization effects (EO residuals, gamma/e-beam crosslinking)
- Surface treatments (plasma, corona, chemical etching, coatings)

**Step 3.2: Manufacturing Process Characterization**

Document:
- Extrusion/molding parameters (temperature, pressure, residence time)
- Cleaning/degreasing agents and rinse validation
- Assembly methods (adhesives, solvents, welding, crimping)
- Post-processing (annealing, curing, coating application)
- Sterilization validation (EO residuals <ISO 10993-7 limits, radiation dose)

**Step 3.3: Material Equivalence Assessment (for Historical Data Use)**

Historical biocompatibility data may be used if material is equivalent per ISO 10993-1 Section 10.3.

**Equivalence Criteria (ALL must be met):**
1. ✅ Same chemical composition (polymer grade, alloy composition)
2. ✅ Same manufacturing process (extrusion, molding, machining)
3. ✅ Same additives (plasticizers, stabilizers, colorants)
4. ✅ Same sterilization method (EO, gamma, e-beam, steam)
5. ✅ Same surface treatments (coatings, cleaning agents)
6. ✅ Same or more conservative patient contact (contact type, duration)

**Example - EQUIVALENT:**
- Historical device: Polyurethane catheter (Brand X, EO sterilized, 7-day contact)
- New device: Same polyurethane grade (Brand X), EO sterilized, 3-day contact (less duration = more conservative)
- ✅ Material equivalent, historical data acceptable

**Example - NOT EQUIVALENT:**
- Historical device: Polyurethane catheter (Brand X, gamma sterilized)
- New device: Same polyurethane grade (Brand X), EO sterilized
- ❌ Different sterilization → different chemical residuals → NOT equivalent

**Flag if:**
- Material grade or supplier changed vs. historical data
- Manufacturing process differs (different extrusion temperature, additives)
- Sterilization method changed (gamma → EO, different residuals)
- Surface treatment added (coating not present in historical device)

**Step 3.4: Chemical Characterization for Risk Assessment**

Per ISO 10993-18:2020, chemical characterization required to:
1. Identify extractables (compounds released from material)
2. Assess leachables (extractables released under clinical use conditions)
3. Conduct toxicological risk assessment per ISO 10993-17

**Chemical Characterization Workflow:**
- Perform extractables study (harsh extraction conditions to find all potential compounds)
- Identify and quantify extractables using analytical chemistry (GC-MS, LC-MS, ICP-MS)
- Determine leachables (simulate clinical use conditions)
- Assess toxicological risk for each leachable (compare to TTC, published toxicity data)
- Document that daily exposure below safety thresholds

See Section 4 for detailed extractables/leachables study design.

### 4. Extractables and Leachables (E&L) Study Design per ISO 10993-18:2020

**Objective:** Identify all chemicals that could migrate from device materials and assess toxicological risk.

**Step 4.1: Extractables Study (Exhaustive Extraction)**

**Purpose:** Identify ALL potential compounds that could leach from material.

**Extraction Conditions (Harsh, to maximize extraction):**

| Solvent | Polarity | Typical Temp | Duration | Purpose |
|---------|----------|--------------|----------|---------|
| Water | Polar | 50-121°C | 72 hours | Aqueous extractables (salts, polar compounds) |
| Saline (0.9% NaCl) | Polar ionic | 37-50°C | 72 hours | Physiological simulation (ionic compounds) |
| Ethanol (50-95%) | Polar organic | 50°C | 72 hours | Lipophilic extractables (plasticizers, additives) |
| Hexane or heptane | Non-polar | 50°C | 72 hours | Non-polar extractables (oils, lubricants) |
| Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) | Aprotic | 50°C | 72 hours | Aggressive extraction (polymerization residuals) |

**Extraction Ratio:**
- Per ISO 10993-12: Typically 0.2 g/mL or 6 cm²/mL surface area
- Example: 10 g device → extract in 50 mL solvent (0.2 g/mL ratio)

**Analytical Methods:**

| Analyte Type | Analytical Method | Detection Limit |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Volatile organics | GC-MS (headspace or purge-and-trap) | 1-10 ppb |
| Semi-volatile organics | GC-MS | 1-50 ppb |
| Non-volatile organics | LC-MS or LC-UV | 10-100 ppb |
| Metals | ICP-MS or ICP-OES | 1-10 ppb |
| Inorganic ions | Ion chromatography (IC) | 10-100 ppb |

**Required Analytical Performance:**
- Quantitation limit (LOQ) at or below safety concern threshold (typically <1 μg/g)
- Method validation per ICH Q2(R1) or USP <1225>
- Mass balance >80% (identify ≥80% of total extractables mass)

**Step 4.2: Leachables Study (Clinical Use Simulation)**

**Purpose:** Determine which extractables actually leach under clinical use conditions.

**Leachables Extraction Conditions (Simulate clinical use):**

| Device Type | Simulation Conditions | Duration |
|-------------|----------------------|----------|
| Blood-contacting catheter | 0.9% saline at 37°C, dynamic flow | Actual use duration (e.g., 7 days) |
| Orthopedic implant | Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37°C, static | 30-90 days (accelerated aging) |
| Wound dressing | Simulated wound fluid at 32°C, static | Actual wear time (e.g., 7 days) |
| Hemodialysis bloodline | Bovine blood at 37°C, flow 200 mL/min | 4 hours (typical session) |
| Drug delivery implant | PBS at 37°C with sink conditions | Full drug release period (30-365 days) |

**Leachables Analysis:**
- Use same analytical methods as extractables study
- Quantify all leachables ≥analytical detection limit
- Compare leachables profile to extractables (all leachables should be identified in extractables study)

**Flag if:**
- Leachable detected that was NOT in extractables study (incomplete extractables study)
- Leachable concentration exceeds extractables concentration (analytical error or contamination)

**Step 4.3: Toxicological Risk Assessment per ISO 10993-17**

For each identified leachable, assess risk:

**Risk Assessment Workflow:**

1. **Calculate Daily Exposure:**
   - Daily dose (μg/day) = Leachable concentration (μg/g) × Device mass (g) × Extraction fraction × (1 / Contact duration in days)
   - Example: 100 μg/g leachable × 10 g device × 0.5 extraction fraction × (1/7 days) = 71 μg/day

2. **Determine Safety Threshold:**
   - Search published toxicity data (ToxNet, ECHA, REACH databases)
   - Calculate Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) or Permitted Daily Exposure (PDE)
   - If no data: Use Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) approach

**TTC Approach (when no toxicity data available):**

| Exposure Route | TTC (μg/day) | Cramer Class |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| Systemic (blood, implant) | 1.5 μg/day | Class III (high toxicity concern) |
| Systemic | 9 μg/day | Class II (moderate toxicity concern) |
| Systemic | 90 μg/day | Class I (low toxicity concern) |
| Inhalation | 0.15 μg/day | Class III |
| Dermal (intact skin) | 10 μg/day | Class III |

3. **Calculate Margin of Safety (MOS):**
   - MOS = (Safety threshold) / (Daily exposure)
   - Acceptable if MOS ≥ 100 (typical safety factor)
   - Example: 90 μg/day TTC / 71 μg/day exposure = MOS 1.3 ❌ NOT ACCEPTABLE

4. **Risk Conclusion:**
   - ✅ ACCEPTABLE: Daily exposure < safety threshold, MOS ≥ 100
   - ⚠️ REQUIRES MITIGATION: Daily exposure exceeds TTC but <published NOAEL
   - ❌ UNACCEPTABLE: Daily exposure exceeds safety threshold

**Flag if:**
- Leachable exceeds TTC and no published toxicity data to support higher exposure
- Carcinogenic or mutagenic compound detected (even at trace levels)
- Endocrine disruptor detected (e.g., phthalates, bisphenol A)
- Heavy metals exceed ICH Q3D limits (Pb <5 μg/day, Hg <3 μg/day, Cd <2.5 μg/day)

**Step 4.4: E&L Study Report Requirements**

E&L report must include:
1. **Material Description:** All patient-contacting materials, grades, suppliers
2. **Extraction Study Design:** Solvents, conditions, ratios per ISO 10993-12
3. **Analytical Methods:** GC-MS, LC-MS, ICP-MS methods with validation data
4. **Extractables Results:** Full compound list with CAS numbers, concentrations, structures
5. **Leachables Results:** Clinical simulation conditions, compound list, concentrations
6. **Toxicological Risk Assessment:** Daily exposure calculations, safety thresholds, MOS, conclusions per ISO 10993-17
7. **GLP Compliance:** Statement of GLP compliance per 21 CFR 58 (required for FDA submissions)

**Common Deficiencies:**
- Extraction solvents don't cover all polarities (missing non-polar or aprotic solvent)
- Extraction temperature too low (room temp vs. elevated temp to accelerate extraction)
- Analytical detection limits too high (can't detect compounds below TTC)
- Mass balance <80% (unknown compounds not identified)
- Leachables study uses wrong simulation fluid (water vs. blood/saline)
- Toxicological risk assessment missing or qualitative only (no MOS calculations)
- No GLP statement (21 CFR 58 compliance required for FDA)

### 5. Blood-Contacting Device Testing per ISO 10993-4:2017

**Applies to:** Devices with direct or indirect blood contact (catheters, blood bags, dialyzers, oxygenators, vascular implants, drug delivery systems)

**Required Hemocompatibility Tests:**

| Test | Standard | Purpose | Acceptance Criteria |
|------|----------|---------|---------------------|
| Hemolysis | ISO 10993-4 Section 5.2 | RBC lysis | <2% hemolysis (ASTM F756) |
| Thrombogenicity | ISO 10993-4 Section 5.3 | Clot formation | No visible clots, <FDA predicate |
| Coagulation | ISO 10993-4 Annex C | Clotting cascade activation | PT/aPTT <150% of control |
| Platelet activation | ISO 10993-4 Annex D | Platelet adhesion/aggregation | PF4, β-TG, P-selectin <control |
| Complement activation | ISO 10993-4 Annex E | Immune response | C3a, C5a, SC5b-9 <control |
| Leukocyte activation | ISO 10993-4 Annex F | WBC response | CD11b, elastase <control |
| Hematology | ISO 10993-4 Section 5.5 | Blood cell counts | WBC, RBC, platelets within normal |

**Test Material Requirements:**
- Use final finished device (sterilized, ready-to-use condition)
- If device too large, use representative material coupons (same material, processing, sterilization)
- Surface area calculation critical for dose-response (record total blood-contacting surface area)

**Blood Source:**
- Fresh human blood (anticoagulated with citrate, heparin, or hirudin per test method)
- Donor screening per blood bank standards
- Use pooled blood from ≥3 donors (reduces donor-to-donor variability)

**Common Deficiencies:**
- Hemolysis test performed on material coupons instead of actual device (different surface area)
- Blood not fresh (<4 hours from draw to test initiation)
- Only hemolysis tested (thrombogenicity, complement activation missing for high-risk devices)
- Acceptance criteria not justified (no comparison to predicate or published data)

**Device-Specific Considerations:**

| Device Type | Critical Tests | Rationale |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| Central venous catheter | Hemolysis, thrombogenicity, complement | Prolonged blood contact (days to weeks) |
| Drug-eluting stent | Thrombogenicity, platelet activation | Permanent implant, drug leaching may affect coagulation |
| Hemodialysis membrane | Complement activation, leukocyte activation | Large surface area, repeated use, inflammatory response |
| Blood oxygenator | Hemolysis, platelet activation | High shear stress, gas exchange |
| Vascular graft | Thrombogenicity, platelet activation | Permanent implant, thrombosis risk high |

### 6. Carcinogenicity Assessment for Permanent Implants (>30 days)

**Regulatory Requirement:**
- ISO 10993-1:2018 Table A.1: Carcinogenicity testing REQUIRED for Category C (>30 days) implants
- FDA Blue Book Memo G95-1: "Use of International Standard ISO 10993-1, Biological evaluation of medical devices"

**Step 6.1: Determine if Carcinogenicity Testing Required**

**REQUIRED for:**
- ✅ Implants with >30 days patient contact (Category C)
- ✅ Examples: Orthopedic implants, cardiac pacemakers, breast implants, IUDs, drug delivery implants, vascular stents

**NOT REQUIRED for:**
- ❌ Limited contact (<24 hours, Category A)
- ❌ Prolonged contact (24h-30d, Category B)
- ❌ External devices (no implantation)

**MAY BE WAIVED if:**
- Material has extensive safe use history (e.g., titanium alloys, medical-grade silicone with decades of implant use)
- Historical carcinogenicity data exists for equivalent material (see Section 3.3 for equivalence criteria)
- Chemical characterization shows no carcinogenic compounds (per E&L study) AND material is inert

**Step 6.2: Carcinogenicity Study Design**

**Two Approaches:**

**Option 1: In Vivo Carcinogenicity Bioassay (ISO 10993-3 Annex E)**

- **Study Type:** Lifetime rodent implantation study (typically 2 years in rats or mice)
- **Test Article:** Implant material coupons or actual device
- **Implant Site:** Subcutaneous or intramuscular (site should be clinically relevant)
- **Group Size:** ≥50 animals per group (device group, sham surgery control, negative control)
- **Duration:** Lifetime exposure (until natural death or 24-30 months)
- **Endpoints:**
  - Tumor incidence (local tumors at implant site, distant tumors)
  - Tumor latency (time to tumor development)
  - Tumor type (histopathology classification)
  - Survival rate
- **Acceptance Criteria:** No statistically significant increase in tumor incidence vs. controls

**Cost:** $500,000 - $1,200,000 per study (2-year duration, GLP compliance, histopathology)
**Timeline:** 3-4 years (study design, execution, pathology review, report)

**Option 2: Weight of Evidence Approach (ISO 10993-1 Section 10.4)**

If in vivo carcinogenicity bioassay waived, provide:

1. **Material Chemical Identity:**
   - Complete chemical composition (polymer, alloy, ceramic composition)
   - Additives, residuals, degradation products (from E&L study)

2. **Genotoxicity Data:**
   - Ames test (bacterial mutation) - NEGATIVE
   - Chromosomal aberration (mammalian cells in vitro) - NEGATIVE
   - Micronucleus test (mammalian cells in vivo) - NEGATIVE
   - If genotoxicity POSITIVE → carcinogenicity bioassay REQUIRED

3. **Chronic Toxicity Data:**
   - 90-day or 6-month implantation study (ISO 10993-6)
   - No evidence of preneoplastic lesions, hyperplasia, or dysplasia at implant site
   - Histopathology review by board-certified pathologist

4. **Literature Review:**
   - Published data on carcinogenicity of material or chemical constituents
   - IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer) classification
   - NTP (National Toxicology Program) carcinogenicity studies
   - Human epidemiology data (if available)

5. **Safe Use History:**
   - Material used in similar devices for ≥10 years without carcinogenicity signals
   - Post-market surveillance data (MAUDE, literature case reports) show no cancer association

**Flag if:**
- Permanent implant (>30 days) with no carcinogenicity assessment
- Genotoxicity positive (carcinogenicity bioassay required, not waivable)
- Material contains known carcinogens (IARC Group 1 or 2A compounds)
- Weight of evidence incomplete (missing genotoxicity, chronic toxicity, or literature review)

**Step 6.3: Specific Material Considerations**

**Metals and Alloys:**
- Titanium alloys (Ti-6Al-4V): Extensive safe use, typically no carcinogenicity testing required
- Cobalt-chromium alloys: Cobalt is IARC Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic) - require weight of evidence
- Nickel-containing alloys (e.g., nitinol): Nickel compounds IARC Group 1 (carcinogenic) - require carcinogenicity bioassay OR demonstrate no nickel release via E&L

**Polymers:**
- Medical-grade silicone (polydimethylsiloxane): Extensive implant history, typically waived
- Polyurethanes: Require genotoxicity + chronic toxicity (some aromatic diisocyanates carcinogenic)
- PEEK (polyether ether ketone): Relatively inert, genotoxicity + safe use history typically sufficient
- Biodegradable polymers (PLA, PLGA): Degradation products (lactic acid, glycolic acid) well-characterized, typically waived

**Ceramics:**
- Alumina, zirconia: Inert, extensive orthopedic use, typically waived
- Hydroxyapatite: Bone-derived material, safe use history, typically waived

### 7. Degradable Material Characterization per ISO 10993-9, -13, -14, -15, -16

**Applies to:** Biodegradable, bioresorbable, or degradable device materials (absorbable sutures, PLA/PLGA implants, magnesium stents, collagen scaffolds)

**Degradation Characterization Requirements:**

**ISO 10993-9: Framework for identification and quantification of degradation products**

- Identify degradation mechanism (hydrolysis, enzymatic, oxidative, corrosion)
- Quantify degradation rate (mass loss, molecular weight reduction, mechanical property loss)
- Identify all degradation products (monomers, oligomers, byproducts)
- Measure degradation product release kinetics (in vitro and in vivo)

**ISO 10993-13: Identification and quantification of degradation products from polymeric medical devices**

- Analytical methods for polymer degradation products (GC-MS, LC-MS, NMR, GPC)
- Example: PLA degrades to lactic acid → quantify lactic acid release over time

**ISO 10993-14: Identification and quantification of degradation products from ceramics**

- Ceramic dissolution testing (ion release from hydroxyapatite, calcium phosphate)
- Example: Hydroxyapatite degrades to Ca²⁺ and PO₄³⁻ → measure ion concentrations

**ISO 10993-15: Identification and quantification of degradation products from metals and alloys**

- Corrosion testing (electrochemical, immersion, accelerated aging)
- Example: Magnesium alloy stent → measure Mg²⁺ release, hydrogen gas evolution

**ISO 10993-16: Toxicokinetic study design for degradation products and leachables**

- In vivo absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME) studies
- Determine if degradation products accumulate or are eliminated
- Example: Lactic acid from PLA implant → measure blood lactate levels over time

**Degradable Material Test Matrix:**

In addition to standard biocompatibility tests (cytotoxicity, sensitization, etc.), REQUIRED:

- ✅ In vitro degradation study (accelerated aging in PBS or enzymes, measure mass loss and degradation products)
- ✅ In vivo degradation study (implant material, explant at time points, measure degradation rate and histology)
- ✅ Degradation product toxicity testing (test identified degradation products separately)
- ✅ Local tissue response to degradation products (histopathology at implant site during degradation)
- ✅ Systemic exposure to degradation products (blood, urine levels if systemic distribution expected)

**Common Deficiencies:**
- Degradation products identified in vitro but not tested for toxicity
- In vivo degradation rate not measured (only in vitro data, may not reflect clinical degradation)
- Degradation byproducts not fully characterized (only parent polymer tested, not oligomers or monomers)
- Local tissue response during degradation not assessed (only final time point, miss inflammatory response)

## Common Deficiency Patterns (FDA Biocompatibility Deficiency Library)

### Test Matrix Incomplete (ISO 10993-1)

**#1 Most Common:** Missing carcinogenicity assessment for permanent implants

**Example:** "Device is permanent implant (>30 days contact) but no carcinogenicity assessment provided. ISO 10993-1:2018 Table A.1 requires carcinogenicity evaluation for Category C implants."

**Fix:** Provide weight of evidence (genotoxicity NEGATIVE, chronic tox, literature, safe use history) OR conduct carcinogenicity bioassay.

**#2:** Hemocompatibility not addressed for blood-contacting device

**Example:** "Device contacts blood but only cytotoxicity, sensitization, irritation tested. ISO 10993-4 hemocompatibility testing required (hemolysis, thrombogenicity, coagulation)."

**Fix:** Conduct ISO 10993-4 battery: hemolysis, thrombogenicity, coagulation (PT/aPTT), platelet activation, complement activation.

**#3:** Genotoxicity missing for prolonged/permanent contact

**Example:** "Device is Category C (permanent) but no genotoxicity testing. ISO 10993-1 Table A.1 requires genotoxicity for Category B and C devices."

**Fix:** Conduct genotoxicity battery: Ames test (bacterial mutation), chromosomal aberration (mammalian cells in vitro), micronucleus (mammalian in vivo).

### Material Characterization Insufficient (ISO 10993-18)

**#1:** Material equivalence not demonstrated for historical data use

**Example:** "Firm cited historical biocompatibility data for 'polyurethane' but did not demonstrate material equivalence. Different supplier and sterilization method (EO vs. gamma) - NOT equivalent per ISO 10993-1 Section 10.3."

**Fix:** Conduct full biocompatibility testing OR demonstrate material equivalence (same grade, supplier, processing, sterilization, additives).

**#2:** Chemical identity not established

**Example:** "Material listed as 'medical grade silicone' without manufacturer, grade, or composition. Chemical identity required per ISO 10993-18 for risk assessment."

**Fix:** Obtain material data sheet from supplier with full chemical composition, grade, additives, and attach to biocompatibility summary.

**#3:** Sterilization residuals not characterized

**Example:** "Device EO sterilized but no EO residual testing per ISO 10993-7. EO, ECH, and EG residuals are toxic leachables."

**Fix:** Test EO residuals per ISO 10993-7, ensure <4 mg EO/device, <2 mg ECH/device, <250 mg EG/device (or conduct toxicological risk assessment if higher).

### Extractables/Leachables Study Design Gaps (ISO 10993-18)

**#1:** Extraction conditions not per ISO 10993-12

**Example:** "Extraction performed at room temperature for 24 hours. ISO 10993-12 recommends elevated temperature (≥37°C) and 72 hours for exhaustive extraction."

**Fix:** Repeat extraction at 50°C for 72 hours to ensure complete extraction of additives and residuals.

**#2:** Analytical detection limits too high

**Example:** "GC-MS detection limit 100 ppb, but TTC for systemic exposure is 1.5 μg/day (equivalent to ~15 ppb for 10g device). Cannot detect compounds below safety threshold."

**Fix:** Optimize analytical methods to achieve detection limits ≤10 ppb (or lower to align with TTC).

**#3:** Toxicological risk assessment missing

**Example:** "E&L study identified 15 extractables but no toxicological risk assessment. ISO 10993-17 requires risk assessment for all leachables."

**Fix:** Calculate daily exposure for each leachable, compare to safety thresholds (TTC or published ADI/PDE), calculate MOS, conclude acceptable or not.

**#4:** Leachables study does not simulate clinical use

**Example:** "Leachables extracted in water at 37°C, but device contacts blood. Blood proteins and lipids may extract different compounds than water."

**Fix:** Repeat leachables study in simulated use conditions (e.g., plasma, saline with albumin, or actual blood).

### Blood Compatibility Gaps (ISO 10993-4)

**#1:** Only hemolysis tested (incomplete hemocompatibility battery)

**Example:** "Hemolysis <2% (pass), but no thrombogenicity or complement activation testing. ISO 10993-4 requires multiple endpoints for blood-contacting devices, especially long-term contact."

**Fix:** Conduct full hemocompatibility battery: hemolysis, thrombogenicity, coagulation, platelet activation, complement activation per ISO 10993-4.

**#2:** Test material not representative of final device

**Example:** "Hemocompatibility tested on polymer pellets. Final device has surface treatments (hydrophilic coating, drug elution) not present in test article."

**Fix:** Test final finished device (sterilized, with all coatings/treatments) or demonstrate coating does not affect blood compatibility.

### Carcinogenicity Assessment Gaps

**#1:** Permanent implant with no carcinogenicity assessment

**Example:** "Orthopedic implant (>10 years contact) with no carcinogenicity evaluation. ISO 10993-1 Table A.1 requires carcinogenicity assessment for Category C (>30 days) implants."

**Fix:** Provide weight of evidence OR conduct carcinogenicity bioassay (see Section 6 workflow).

**#2:** Weight of evidence incomplete

**Example:** "Firm waived carcinogenicity bioassay but provided only genotoxicity data. Weight of evidence requires genotoxicity + chronic toxicity + literature review + safe use history."

**Fix:** Complete weight of evidence: Add 90-day implantation study, literature review (IARC, NTP), and safe use history (post-market data).

**#3:** Genotoxicity positive but carcinogenicity not tested

**Example:** "In vitro chromosomal aberration test POSITIVE (clastogenic), but no in vivo follow-up or carcinogenicity bioassay."

**Fix:** Genotoxicity positive requires carcinogenicity bioassay (cannot waive with weight of evidence if genotoxic).

### Degradable Material Gaps

**#1:** Degradation products not characterized

**Example:** "PLGA implant degrades to lactic acid and glycolic acid, but only parent polymer tested for biocompatibility. Degradation product toxicity not assessed."

**Fix:** Test degradation products separately (lactic acid, glycolic acid) for cytotoxicity, sensitization, systemic toxicity per ISO 10993-13.

**#2:** In vivo degradation rate not measured

**Example:** "In vitro degradation shows 50% mass loss at 6 months, but no in vivo degradation study. In vivo rate may differ due to enzymatic degradation."

**Fix:** Conduct in vivo implantation study with explants at multiple time points (e.g., 1, 3, 6, 12 months) to measure degradation rate and local tissue response per ISO 10993-9.

## Expert Tips

### For 510(k) Submissions:
- **RTA Risk Drivers:** Incomplete test matrix (missing ISO 10993-1 required tests), no carcinogenicity assessment for permanent implants, E&L study not per ISO 10993-18
- **Predicate Comparison:** If predicate has same materials and processing, cite predicate biocompatibility data (demonstrate material equivalence)
- **Test Report Summaries:** Provide concise test report summaries (1-2 pages each) in main 510(k), full reports in appendices

### For PMA Submissions:
- **Complete Test Battery:** PMA requires 100% test matrix completeness (no waivers without strong justification)
- **GLP Compliance:** All testing must be GLP-compliant per 21 CFR 58 (non-GLP data not acceptable)
- **Carcinogenicity:** For permanent implants, weight of evidence approach often insufficient - expect carcinogenicity bioassay request
- **Advisory Panel Prep:** Panel members will ask about material toxicity, E&L data - have detailed chemical characterization ready

### For Combination Products (Device + Drug):
- **Drug Leaching:** Drug is a leachable - must assess drug exposure via device material interaction (not just intended drug dose)
- **Excipients:** Drug formulation excipients (solvents, preservatives, stabilizers) are extractables - include in E&L study
- **Biocompatibility vs. Pharmacology:** Biocompatibility focuses on material toxicity; pharmacology assesses drug efficacy/safety - both required

### For Blood-Contacting Devices:
- **Hemocompatibility is Critical:** Blood contact devices have highest biocompatibility risk - expect FDA scrutiny
- **Test on Final Device:** Use actual device (sterilized, final configuration), not coupons, for hemocompatibility testing when feasible
- **Predicate Comparison:** Compare hemocompatibility results to predicate device (show equivalence or improvement)
- **Thrombogenicity is Key:** For intravascular devices (catheters, stents), thrombogenicity is most critical endpoint

### For Permanent Implants (>30 days):
- **Carcinogenicity Non-Negotiable:** FDA will not accept permanent implant without carcinogenicity assessment
- **Start Early:** Carcinogenicity bioassay takes 3-4 years - plan early in development
- **Weight of Evidence Strategy:** If bioassay waived, provide comprehensive weight of evidence (genotoxicity, chronic tox, literature, safe use history) upfront
- **Material Selection:** Use materials with extensive implant history (titanium, medical silicone, PEEK) to facilitate weight of evidence approach

### For Sterilized Devices:
- **EO Residuals:** EO sterilization produces toxic residuals (EO, ECH, EG) - test per ISO 10993-7, include in E&L study
- **Gamma/E-Beam:** Radiation can cause polymer crosslinking, free radical formation - may create new extractables not present in unsterilized material
- **Steam Sterilization:** High temperature/moisture may leach additives - verify E&L study uses sterilized samples

## Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Permanent Orthopedic Implant (Category C, >30 days, Tissue Contact)

**Input:** User developing spinal fusion cage (PEEK polymer with titanium coating), permanent implant, requests biocompatibility strategy.

**Output:**
```
Device: Spinal fusion cage (PEEK + titanium coating), Class II, permanent implant (>10 years)
Contact: Tissue/bone contact, Category C (>30 days permanent)

ISO 10993-1 Test Matrix (Permanent Implant):

✅ REQUIRED Tests:
1. Cytotoxicity (ISO 10993-5) - REQUIRED all devices
2. Sensitization (ISO 10993-10) - REQUIRED all devices
3. Irritation/Intracutaneous (ISO 10993-10) - REQUIRED all devices
4. Systemic toxicity - acute (ISO 10993-11) - REQUIRED all devices
5. Subchronic toxicity (ISO 10993-11) - REQUIRED Category C (28-day study minimum)
6. Genotoxicity (ISO 10993-3) - REQUIRED Category C (Ames + CA + MN)
7. Implantation (ISO 10993-6) - REQUIRED for implants (12-week study minimum for Category C)
8. Chronic toxicity (ISO 10993-11) - REQUIRED Category C (90-day study)
9. Carcinogenicity (ISO 10993-3) - REQUIRED Category C permanent implants

❌ NOT REQUIRED:
- Hemocompatibility (ISO 10993-4) - No blood contact
- Biodegradation (ISO 10993-9) - PEEK is non-degradable

Material Characterization:
- PEEK polymer: Grade [Supplier, specific grade e.g., PEEK-OPTIMA™ LT1]
  - Chemical identity: Poly(ether ether ketone), semi-crystalline aromatic polymer
  - Additives: None (unfilled PEEK) or carbon fiber (check with supplier)
  - Processing: Injection molded at [temperature], machined surfaces
  - Sterilization: Gamma 25-40 kGy (verify dose)

- Titanium coating: Ti-6Al-4V alloy or cp-Ti (commercial purity titanium)
  - Coating method: Plasma spray, PVD, or grit blast + acid etch (specify)
  - Coating thickness: [μm]
  - Sterilization: Gamma 25-40 kGy

Material Equivalence Assessment:
- PEEK: If using PEEK-OPTIMA™ LT1 (Invibio), extensive biocompatibility data available
  - Can cite historical data IF same grade, gamma sterilization dose, no coating
  - Titanium coating changes surface → cannot use PEEK-only historical data
  - Recommendation: Test coated PEEK (composite material)

Carcinogenicity Strategy (CRITICAL for permanent implant):
Option 1 - Weight of Evidence (faster, lower cost):
1. Genotoxicity: Ames NEGATIVE, CA NEGATIVE, MN NEGATIVE (required)
2. Chronic toxicity: 90-day or 6-month implantation study, no preneoplastic lesions
3. Literature review:
   - PEEK: Extensive orthopedic implant use >20 years, no cancer association (cite literature)
   - Titanium: IARC Group 4 (not classifiable, likely not carcinogenic), safe use history
4. Post-market data: Review MAUDE for PEEK spinal cages, check for cancer reports (expect zero)

Option 2 - Carcinogenicity Bioassay (most conservative, FDA may request if Option 1 questioned):
- Study: 2-year rat subcutaneous implantation, 50 rats/group
- Timeline: 3-4 years (study execution + pathology review)
- Cost: $800,000 - $1,200,000
- Recommendation: Start with Option 1; if FDA requests bioassay in deficiency letter, conduct then

Extractables/Leachables Study per ISO 10993-18:
- Extraction solvents: Water, saline, ethanol 50%, hexane (cover all polarities)
- Extraction conditions: 50°C, 72 hours, 0.2 g/mL ratio per ISO 10993-12
- Analytical methods:
  - GC-MS (volatile/semi-volatile organics from PEEK)
  - ICP-MS (metals: Ti, Al, V from titanium coating)
- Expected extractables:
  - PEEK: Very low extractables (chemically inert), may see trace oligomers
  - Titanium coating: Trace Ti, Al, V ion release
- Toxicological risk assessment:
  - Ti, Al, V: Compare to ICH Q3D limits (Ti <1000 μg/day, Al <500 μg/day, V <20 μg/day)
  - Expect all well below limits (PEEK and Ti very biocompatible)

Deficiencies (if current data incomplete):
CRITICAL:
- #1: No carcinogenicity assessment (Category C permanent implant requires per ISO 10993-1)
  - Action: Provide weight of evidence (genotoxicity + chronic tox + literature) within 60 days
  - Timeline: 6-8 months if testing needed (genotox 3 mo, chronic tox 6 mo, literature review 1 mo)

MAJOR:
- #2: E&L study not conducted on coated PEEK (only uncoated PEEK tested)
  - Action: Conduct E&L study on titanium-coated PEEK (sterilized final material)
  - Timeline: 3-4 months (extraction + analysis + risk assessment)
  - Cost: $25,000 - $40,000

Biocompatibility Readiness: 40/100 (NOT READY - critical gaps)
Estimated Timeline to Readiness: 8-10 months (if start weight of evidence now)
Estimated Cost: $150,000 - $250,000 (genotoxicity $30K, chronic tox $80K, E&L $40K, reports $20K)
```

### Use Case 2: Blood-Contacting Central Venous Catheter (Category B, 7-14 days)

**Input:** User developing central venous catheter (polyurethane, 7-14 day dwelling time), requests hemocompatibility testing strategy.

**Output:**
```
Device: Central venous catheter (CVC), polyurethane, Class II
Contact: Blood (direct contact via intravascular catheter), Category B (7-14 days prolonged)

ISO 10993-1 Test Matrix (Blood Contact, Prolonged):

✅ REQUIRED Tests:
1. Cytotoxicity (ISO 10993-5) - REQUIRED
2. Sensitization (ISO 10993-10) - REQUIRED
3. Irritation (ISO 10993-10) - REQUIRED
4. Systemic toxicity - acute (ISO 10993-11) - REQUIRED
5. Subchronic toxicity (ISO 10993-11) - REQUIRED Category B (28-day study)
6. Genotoxicity (ISO 10993-3) - REQUIRED Category B (Ames + CA + MN)
7. Hemocompatibility (ISO 10993-4) - REQUIRED for blood contact ⚠️ CRITICAL
   - Hemolysis
   - Thrombogenicity (most critical for intravascular devices)
   - Coagulation (PT/aPTT)
   - Platelet activation (PF4, β-TG)
   - Complement activation (C3a, C5a, SC5b-9) - especially if large surface area

❌ NOT REQUIRED:
- Implantation (not implanted, intravascular only)
- Chronic toxicity (Category B, not C)
- Carcinogenicity (Category B <30 days, not required)

Hemocompatibility Testing Strategy per ISO 10993-4 (CRITICAL):

Test Article: Final CVC (sterilized, all components: catheter shaft, hub, luer connector)
Blood Source: Fresh human blood (<4 hours from draw), pooled from ≥3 donors, citrate anticoagulated
Blood-Contacting Surface Area: Calculate total (catheter lumen + outer surface) = ~150 cm² (for typical 20cm CVC, 7Fr diameter)

Hemocompatibility Battery:

1. Hemolysis (ISO 10993-4 Section 5.2):
   - Method: Catheter segment incubated in diluted blood (10:1 ratio), 37°C, 3 hours
   - Measurement: Spectrophotometry (hemoglobin release), compare to positive control (water) and negative control (saline)
   - Acceptance: <2% hemolysis per ASTM F756
   - Timeline: 1 week
   - Cost: $2,000 - $3,000

2. Thrombogenicity (ISO 10993-4 Section 5.3) ⚠️ MOST CRITICAL FOR CVCs:
   - Method: Catheter segment in flowing blood circuit (mock circulation), 37°C, 1-4 hours
   - Measurement: Visual clot inspection, clot weight, platelet count reduction
   - Acceptance: No visible clots, clot weight <predicate device, platelet count >70% of baseline
   - Timeline: 2 weeks
   - Cost: $8,000 - $12,000

3. Coagulation (ISO 10993-4 Annex C):
   - Method: Blood contact with catheter, measure PT (prothrombin time) and aPTT (activated partial thromboplastin time)
   - Acceptance: PT and aPTT <150% of negative control (no significant clotting cascade activation)
   - Timeline: 1 week
   - Cost: $3,000 - $5,000

4. Platelet Activation (ISO 10993-4 Annex D):
   - Method: Measure platelet activation markers: PF4 (platelet factor 4), β-TG (beta-thromboglobulin), P-selectin (CD62P)
   - Acceptance: PF4 and β-TG <control + 20% (no significant platelet activation)
   - Timeline: 2 weeks
   - Cost: $6,000 - $10,000

5. Complement Activation (ISO 10993-4 Annex E):
   - Method: Measure complement markers: C3a, C5a, SC5b-9 (membrane attack complex)
   - Acceptance: C3a/C5a/SC5b-9 <control + 50% (no significant complement activation)
   - Rationale: Large surface area (150 cm²) + prolonged contact (7-14 days) → complement risk
   - Timeline: 2 weeks
   - Cost: $8,000 - $12,000

Total Hemocompatibility Testing: $27,000 - $42,000, Timeline: 4-6 weeks (if sequential), 3 weeks (if parallel)

Material Characterization (Polyurethane):
- Polyurethane grade: [e.g., Pellethane® 2363-80AE, Lubrizol]
- Chemical composition: Aromatic polyether urethane
- Additives: BaSO₄ (radiopaque filler, typically 10-20 wt%)
- Sterilization: EO (ethylene oxide)
- Critical: EO residuals must be tested per ISO 10993-7 (EO <4 mg/device, ECH <2 mg, EG <250 mg)

E&L Study per ISO 10993-18:
- Extractables:
  - Solvents: Water, saline, ethanol, hexane
  - Expected: Aromatic amines (from aromatic diisocyanate), polyether oligomers, BaSO₄ particles, EO residuals
- Leachables (critical for blood contact):
  - Simulation: Fresh human blood or bovine blood, 37°C, 14 days (worst-case contact duration)
  - Analytical: GC-MS (organics), ICP-MS (barium from BaSO₄)
- Toxicological Risk Assessment:
  - Aromatic amines: Some are carcinogenic (e.g., MDA, TDA) - CRITICAL to identify and quantify
  - EO residuals: Acute toxicity concern - must be below ISO 10993-7 limits
  - Barium: Compare to ICH Q3D limit (Ba <200 μg/day)

Deficiencies (if current data gaps):
CRITICAL:
- #1: Hemocompatibility testing not conducted (blood-contacting device REQUIRES ISO 10993-4)
  - Action: Conduct full hemocompatibility battery (hemolysis, thrombogenicity, coagulation, platelet, complement)
  - Timeline: 6-8 weeks (including test article preparation)
  - Cost: $30,000 - $45,000

- #2: EO residuals not tested (EO sterilization produces toxic residuals)
  - Action: Test per ISO 10993-7 (GC headspace analysis for EO, ECH, EG)
  - Timeline: 2 weeks
  - Cost: $3,000 - $5,000

MAJOR:
- #3: E&L study used saline, not blood (leachables in blood may differ due to protein/lipid interaction)
  - Action: Repeat leachables study in blood or blood simulant (plasma + albumin)
  - Timeline: 4-6 weeks
  - Cost: $15,000 - $25,000

RTA Risk: HIGH (blood-contacting device without hemocompatibility data is RTA trigger)

### Use Case 3: Biodegradable PLGA Drug Delivery Implant (Category C, Degradable)

**Input:** User developing biodegradable subcutaneous implant (PLGA polymer with drug), 6-month degradation, requests degradation characterization strategy.

**Output:**
```
Device: Biodegradable drug delivery implant (PLGA 50:50, subcutaneous), Class III PMA
Contact: Tissue contact (subcutaneous implant), Category C (>30 days, degrades over 6 months)
Material: PLGA 50:50 (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), 50% lactic acid, 50% glycolic acid)

ISO 10993-1 Test Matrix (Degradable Implant, Category C):

✅ REQUIRED Tests (Standard Biocompatibility):
1. Cytotoxicity (ISO 10993-5)
2. Sensitization (ISO 10993-10)
3. Irritation (ISO 10993-10)
4. Systemic toxicity - acute (ISO 10993-11)
5. Subchronic toxicity (ISO 10993-11) - 28-day
6. Genotoxicity (ISO 10993-3) - Ames + CA + MN
7. Implantation (ISO 10993-6) - 12-week minimum
8. Chronic toxicity (ISO 10993-11) - 90-day (cover degradation period)
9. Carcinogenicity (ISO 10993-3) - REQUIRED Category C >30 days

✅ REQUIRED Tests (Degradable Material-Specific per ISO 10993-9/-13):
10. Biodegradation characterization (ISO 10993-9) - in vitro and in vivo degradation kinetics
11. Degradation product identification (ISO 10993-13) - lactic acid, glycolic acid quantification
12. Degradation product toxicity (ISO 10993-11/-5) - test lactic acid and glycolic acid separately
13. Local tissue response during degradation (ISO 10993-6) - histopathology at multiple time points
14. Systemic exposure to degradation products (ISO 10993-16) - blood/urine lactate and glycolate levels

Degradation Characterization per ISO 10993-9 and ISO 10993-13:

Step 1: In Vitro Degradation Study (ISO 10993-9)
- Conditions: PBS pH 7.4, 37°C, static
- Time points: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 weeks (until complete degradation)
- Measurements:
  - Mass loss (% remaining mass vs. time)
  - Molecular weight reduction (GPC - gel permeation chromatography)
  - pH change (degradation produces acidic products)
  - Morphology (SEM - scanning electron microscopy, surface erosion vs. bulk degradation)
- Expected: PLGA 50:50 degrades via hydrolysis, complete degradation ~4-6 months
- Timeline: 7 months (6-month degradation + 1-month analysis)
- Cost: $15,000 - $25,000

Step 2: Degradation Product Identification (ISO 10993-13)
- Analytical method: HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) for lactic acid and glycolic acid
- Quantify degradation products at each time point (match mass loss to lactic/glycolic acid release)
- Expected: Stoichiometric release (50% lactic acid, 50% glycolic acid from 50:50 PLGA)
- Timeline: Concurrent with Step 1
- Cost: $10,000 - $15,000

Step 3: In Vivo Degradation Study (ISO 10993-9 + ISO 10993-6)
- Study design: Subcutaneous implantation in rats, 40 rats total
- Time points: 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24 weeks (explant 5-6 rats per time point)
- Measurements at each time point:
  - Explant mass (% mass remaining)
  - Molecular weight (explant samples)
  - Histopathology (local tissue response: inflammation, fibrosis, macrophages, foreign body giant cells)
  - Systemic exposure (blood lactate and glycolate levels via HPLC)
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Degradation rate similar to in vitro (±20%)
  - No severe inflammation (ISO 10993-6 score <2.9 average)
  - No unexpected degradation products (only lactic and glycolic acid)
  - Blood lactate <2× baseline (lactic acid is normal metabolite, should be metabolized)
- Timeline: 8 months (6-month implantation + 2-month histopathology + report)
- Cost: $80,000 - $120,000 (GLP study)

Step 4: Degradation Product Toxicity Testing (ISO 10993-11 and ISO 10993-5)

Test lactic acid and glycolic acid separately:
- Cytotoxicity (ISO 10993-5): Test lactic acid and glycolic acid on L929 fibroblasts
  - Expected: Low toxicity (both are normal metabolites)
- Systemic toxicity (ISO 10993-11): Subcutaneous injection of lactic/glycolic acid in rats (acute and 28-day)
  - Expected: Low toxicity at physiological concentrations
- Timeline: 3 months
- Cost: $30,000 - $50,000

Step 5: Toxicokinetic Study (ISO 10993-16)
- Measure absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME) of lactic and glycolic acid
- Study design: Implant PLGA in rats, measure blood and urine lactate/glycolate over time
- Objective: Demonstrate degradation products are metabolized/excreted (no accumulation)
- Expected: Lactic acid enters Krebs cycle (metabolized to CO₂ + H₂O), glycolic acid metabolized to glyoxylate
- Timeline: Concurrent with in vivo degradation study (Step 3)
- Cost: Included in Step 3 (blood sampling + HPLC analysis)

Carcinogenicity Assessment (PLGA Permanent Implant >30 days):

Weight of Evidence Approach (PLGA is well-characterized, likely acceptable):
1. Genotoxicity: Ames NEGATIVE, CA NEGATIVE, MN NEGATIVE (PLGA and degradation products)
2. Chronic toxicity: 6-month in vivo degradation study (Step 3) serves as chronic toxicity study
   - Histopathology review: No preneoplastic lesions, hyperplasia, or dysplasia expected
3. Literature review:
   - PLGA: FDA-approved for multiple drug delivery devices (Lupron Depot, Zoladex, Atridox)
   - Lactic acid and glycolic acid: Normal human metabolites, GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe)
   - No carcinogenicity reports in >30 years of clinical use
4. Safe use history: 30+ years of PLGA implant use, no cancer association

Conclusion: Carcinogenicity bioassay likely waivable with comprehensive weight of evidence

Material Characterization:
- PLGA grade: 50:50 (lactic:glycolic ratio), molecular weight [specify, e.g., 10-20 kDa for 6-month degradation]
- Supplier: [e.g., Evonik RESOMER® RG 502H]
- Residual monomers: Test for residual lactic acid, glycolic acid, lactide, glycolide (polymerization residuals)
- Sterilization: Gamma 25 kGy (verify PLGA molecular weight stable post-sterilization, gamma can cause chain scission)

E&L Study (PLGA + Drug):
- Extractables:
  - Test PLGA alone: Lactic acid, glycolic acid, residual monomers, initiators
  - Test drug formulation: Drug + excipients (solvents, stabilizers)
- Leachables:
  - Simulation: PBS 37°C, 24 weeks (full degradation period)
  - Expected: Controlled drug release + lactic/glycolic acid release
- Toxicological Risk Assessment:
  - Drug: Assess via pharmacology/toxicology studies (separate from biocompatibility)
  - Lactic/glycolic acid: Compare systemic exposure to normal physiological levels (blood lactate ~1-2 mM baseline)

Deficiency Summary:
CRITICAL:
- #1: In vivo degradation study not conducted (ISO 10993-9 requires in vivo for degradable implants)
  - Action: Conduct 6-month subcutaneous implantation study with histopathology at multiple time points
  - Timeline: 10 months
  - Cost: $100,000 - $130,000

- #2: Degradation product toxicity not tested (lactic acid and glycolic acid must be tested separately per ISO 10993-13)
  - Action: Conduct cytotoxicity and systemic toxicity testing on degradation products
  - Timeline: 4 months
  - Cost: $35,000 - $55,000

MAJOR:
- #3: Carcinogenicity assessment missing (Category C >30 days requires)
  - Action: Provide weight of evidence (genotoxicity + 6-month chronic tox + literature + safe use history)
  - Timeline: 6 months (concurrent with degradation study)
  - Cost: $50,000 (genotoxicity + literature review + report)

Biocompatibility Readiness: 35/100 (NOT READY - critical degradation characterization gaps)
Estimated Timeline to Readiness: 12-14 months (degradation study is long-lead item)
Estimated Cost: $200,000 - $280,000 (degradation study is most expensive component)

Regulatory Strategy:
- PMA device: Expect FDA to request complete degradation characterization (in vitro + in vivo)
- Pre-submission meeting: Present degradation study protocol for FDA feedback before execution
- Advisory panel: Be prepared to present degradation kinetics, local tissue response, and carcinogenicity weight of evidence
