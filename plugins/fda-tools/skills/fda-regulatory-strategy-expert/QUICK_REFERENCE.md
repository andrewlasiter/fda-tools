## Quick Decision Matrix

### Which Pathway Should I Use?

| Your Situation | Recommended Pathway | Key Requirements |
|----------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Predicate exists, same technology** | 510(k) Traditional | Substantial equivalence, performance testing |
| **Predicate exists, robust DHF** | 510(k) Special | Design controls, guidance conformance |
| **Novel device, low-moderate risk** | De Novo | No predicate, general + special controls |
| **Class III, high risk, implanted** | PMA Traditional | Pivotal clinical trial (12-36 months) |
| **Complex PMA, need early feedback** | PMA Modular | Staggered submission (non-clinical → clinical) |
| **Rare disease (<8K patients/year)** | HDE | Safety data (no effectiveness required) |
| **Need clinical data for PMA/De Novo** | IDE | Clinical protocol, IRB approval |

### When Should I Request a Pre-Sub Meeting?

| Pre-Sub Type | Use When | Timing | Turnaround |
|--------------|----------|--------|------------|
| **Submission Issue** | Pathway unclear, testing strategy questions | 3-6 months before submission | 70 days |
| **Agreement** | Need formal FDA agreement on clinical protocol | 6-12 months before submission | 70 days (binding) |
| **Study Risk Determination** | IDE SR vs NSR unclear | Before IDE submission | 70 days |
| **Breakthrough Q-Sub** | Breakthrough device participant | Anytime (unlimited) | 30-45 days |

### What's My RTA Risk?

**CRITICAL (90%+ RTA):**
- ❌ Missing 510(k) Summary or Statement
- ❌ Missing FDA Form 3881 (Indications for Use)
- ❌ Missing Truthful & Accuracy statement signature
- ❌ Predicate device recalled or withdrawn
- ❌ No performance testing for primary device function

**HIGH RISK (70%+ RTA):**
- ⚠️ Incomplete SE comparison table (missing technological characteristics)
- ⚠️ Biocompatibility not addressed (patient-contacting device)
- ⚠️ Sterilization validation missing (sterile device)
- ⚠️ Software documentation missing (device with software)
- ⚠️ Clinical data referenced but not included

**MEDIUM RISK (40-60% RTA):**
- ⚠️ Predicate >10 years old (no justification)
- ⚠️ HFE validation missing (home-use device)
- ⚠️ Cybersecurity not addressed (networked device)
- ⚠️ Shelf life data incomplete

### Am I Eligible for Breakthrough Devices Program?

**Must meet ALL criteria:**
1. ✅ **Life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating disease**
   - Examples: Cancer, ALS, blindness, paralysis, heart failure
   - Counter-examples: Acne, mild osteoarthritis, cosmetic conditions

2. ✅ **Breakthrough technology (meet ONE):**
   - (a) Represents breakthrough technology (no alternatives exist)
   - (b) No approved/cleared alternatives exist
   - (c) Offers significant advantages over existing alternatives

3. ✅ **Preliminary clinical evidence OR credible scientific rationale**
   - Early feasibility study (5-15 patients)
   - Animal proof-of-concept data
   - Bench testing + peer-reviewed publications
   - Key Opinion Leader letters supporting approach

**Benefits if granted:**
- Priority review (dedicated FDA team)
- Unlimited Q-Submissions (vs. 1-2 standard Pre-Subs)
- Sprint discussions (monthly focused meetings)
- Interactive review (FDA co-develops trial design)
- CMS reimbursement support (NTAP eligibility)

## Example Queries

### Pathway Selection
**Query:** "I have a novel continuous glucose monitor using optical sensing. No predicates exist with this technology. What regulatory pathway should I use?"

**Expert Output:**
- Pathway recommendation: De Novo (no substantially equivalent predicate)
- Rationale: Novel technology, Class II risk profile, no predicates
- Clinical requirements: MARD ≤10%, 150 subjects, YSI reference
- Timeline: 23 months (18 months prep + 150 days FDA review)
- Budget: $800K-$1.2M
- Pre-Sub strategy: Agreement Pre-Sub on clinical protocol
- RTA risk: LOW (De Novo has lower RTA rate)
- Breakthrough eligibility: UNCERTAIN (assess after pilot data)

### RTA Assessment
**Query:** "I'm submitting a 510(k) for an orthopedic drill in 30 days. The device is labeled 'Supplied sterile' but we haven't included sterilization validation. What's my RTA risk?"

**Expert Output:**
- RTA likelihood: 90% (CRITICAL GAP)
- Finding: Missing sterilization validation (FDA 2019 RTA Policy requirement)
- Recommendation: Include ISO 11137-2 validation report OR delay submission 90 days
- Alternative: Submit as non-sterile (labeling: "User must sterilize before use")
- Impact: 65% → 20% RTA risk if gap addressed

### Breakthrough Application
**Query:** "We're developing an implantable brain-computer interface for ALS patients. Early feasibility study (5 patients) shows 4/5 achieved cursor control. Should we apply for Breakthrough designation?"

**Expert Output:**
- Breakthrough eligibility: STRONG CANDIDATE (all criteria met)
- Disease: ALS (irreversibly debilitating) ✅
- Technology: First implantable BCI for communication (breakthrough) ✅
- Preliminary evidence: Early feasibility data (5 patients, 12 months) ✅
- Application timing: IMMEDIATE (don't wait for pivotal trial)
- Benefits: Priority review, unlimited Q-Subs, CMS NTAP support
- Timeline impact: 12-18 month reduction (via interactive review)
- Cost savings: $500K-1M (fewer protocol amendments, early GMP guidance)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Pathway Selection
- ❌ Choosing 510(k) when De Novo required (novel technology, no predicate)
- ❌ Choosing PMA when 510(k) sufficient (device reclassified to Class II)
- ❌ Using recalled or withdrawn predicate

### Pre-Submission
- ❌ Too many questions (>5) in Pre-Sub package
- ❌ Vague questions without proposed approach ("What testing do we need?")
- ❌ Skipping Pre-Sub and getting RTA (Pre-Sub is FREE and takes 70 days)

### RTA Prevention
- ❌ Missing administrative elements (Form 3881, Truthful & Accuracy statement)
- ❌ Inadequate SE comparison table (missing technological characteristics)
- ❌ Missing sterilization validation (sterile devices)

### Breakthrough
- ❌ Applying without preliminary clinical evidence (bench testing alone insufficient)
- ❌ Applying for non-life-threatening condition (e.g., acne, cosmetic use)

### Advisory Committee
- ❌ Underestimating panel prep time (need 6+ months, not 60 days)
- ❌ Ignoring FDA briefing document (posted 48 hours before panel)
