**Example:** "Submission did not demonstrate ALARA principle. CTDIvol 40% higher than predicate without clinical justification."
**Fix:** Provide clinical rationale for higher dose (e.g., larger patients, faster acquisition) or implement dose reduction techniques.

**#2:** Missing dose reporting display
**Example:** "CT device does not display CTDIvol and DLP per 21 CFR 1020.33(c)(2)."
**Fix:** Implement dose display on console and in DICOM Dose SR object.

**#3:** Pediatric protocols not validated
**Example:** "No pediatric dose protocols provided. Device marketed for 'all ages' but validation only in adults."
**Fix:** Develop and validate pediatric protocols with age/weight-based dose reduction (≥50% lower than adult).

**#4:** Tube housing leakage exceeds limits
**Example:** "X-ray tube housing leakage measured at 125 mR/hr at 1m (limit: 100 mR/hr per 1020.30(m))."
**Fix:** Improve tube housing shielding or operate at lower maximum technique factors.

### MRI Safety (IEC 60601-2-33)

**#1:** SAR calculations not validated
**Example:** "SAR calculations provided but no phantom testing to verify accuracy."
**Fix:** Perform SAR validation using gel phantoms with temperature probes or MRI-compatible thermometry.

**#2:** Real-time SAR monitoring missing
**Example:** "Device calculates SAR post-acquisition. No real-time monitoring to prevent exceeding limits during scan."
**Fix:** Implement real-time SAR calculation with automatic scan termination if limits approached.

**#3:** Acoustic noise exceeds safe limits
**Example:** "Acoustic noise measured at 108 dB(A) at patient head position (recommended limit: 99 dB(A))."
**Fix:** Implement gradient pulse shaping for quieter operation or provide active noise cancellation headphones.

### CT Image Quality

**#1:** No low-contrast detectability assessment
**Example:** "Only high-contrast MTF provided. No LCD assessment for soft tissue lesions."
**Fix:** Perform LCD phantom testing per ACR CT accreditation (6mm, 0.3% contrast objects).

**#2:** Iterative reconstruction not validated for dose reduction
**Example:** "Iterative reconstruction used to reduce dose by 50%, but no validation that image quality is maintained."
**Fix:** Conduct reader studies showing non-inferiority to filtered back projection at matched dose.

**#3:** HU accuracy not verified
**Example:** "Water HU measured at -8 HU (spec: 0 ± 5 HU)."
**Fix:** Recalibrate CT scanner or adjust reconstruction algorithm to achieve HU accuracy.

### DICOM Conformance

**#1:** DICOM conformance statement incomplete
**Example:** "Conformance statement lists SOP classes but no IOD tables showing which attributes are populated."
**Fix:** Use DICOM conformance statement template (PS3.2) with complete IOD attribute tables.

**#2:** Mandatory DICOM attributes missing
**Example:** "StudyInstanceUID not populated in stored images (Type 1 mandatory attribute)."
**Fix:** Ensure all Type 1 and Type 2 attributes populated per DICOM standard for each SOP class.

**#3:** No interoperability testing
**Example:** "DICOM conformance stated but no testing with commercial PACS systems."
**Fix:** Test image storage and retrieval with ≥3 commercial PACS vendors (GE, Siemens, Philips).

### AI/ML CAD Systems

**#1:** Training data not diverse
**Example:** "Training data from single institution using single CT scanner model. Intended use: all CT scanners."
**Fix:** Include training data from multiple institutions, scanner manufacturers, and acquisition protocols.

**#2:** No independent test dataset
**Example:** "Algorithm tuned using test dataset, then performance reported on same dataset."
**Fix:** Use three-way split: training (70%), validation (15% for tuning), test (15% locked until final evaluation).

**#3:** Subgroup performance not assessed
**Example:** "Overall AUC 0.91 reported. No breakdown by patient demographics or scanner type."
**Fix:** Report sensitivity/specificity stratified by age, sex, race, BMI, and scanner manufacturer.

**#4:** Clinical validation only retrospective
**Example:** "Algorithm validated on archival images. No reader study or prospective validation."
**Fix:** Conduct multi-reader multi-case (MRMC) study showing CAD improves radiologist performance.

**#5:** Explainability missing for high-risk decisions
**Example:** "Deep learning model outputs cancer probability but no explanation of features used."
**Fix:** Implement Grad-CAM or attention visualization showing image regions contributing to prediction.

### Ultrasound Safety

**#1:** MI/TI display inaccurate
**Example:** "MI displayed as 0.8 but calculated from transducer data as 1.3."
**Fix:** Validate MI/TI calculations against FDA-accepted acoustic measurement methods (ODS guidance).

**#2:** HIFU thermal safety not demonstrated
**Example:** "Ablation ultrasound with no temperature monitoring or thermal dose calculation."
**Fix:** Implement MR thermometry guidance or thermocouples with thermal dose (CEM43) calculation.

## Guardrails

- **No Medical Advice:** Frame as regulatory compliance support, not clinical imaging advice
- **No Approval Decisions:** Provide findings, not FDA clearance/approval predictions
- **Evidence-Based:** Cite specific CFR sections, IEC standards, NEMA protocols for each deficiency
- **Quantitative:** Use measured dose values (mGy, W/kg), image quality metrics (SNR, MTF), not subjective terms
- **Physics-Grounded:** Apply medical physics principles (ALARA, SNR vs. dose trade-offs)
- **Modality-Specific:** Tailor assessment to imaging physics (MRI ≠ CT ≠ ultrasound)
- **Risk-Prioritized:** Categorize as CRITICAL (radiation safety, patient harm), MAJOR (image quality, compliance), MINOR (best practice)
- **Actionable:** Every deficiency must have clear corrective action with performance target
- **Confidentiality:** Do not share device performance data outside authorized team

## Expert Tips

### For MRI Device Submissions:
- **SAR Validation is Critical:** FDA expects phantom testing, not just calculations. Use ASTM F2182 gel phantoms.
- **7T and Ultra-High Field:** Additional safety concerns (magnetophosphenes, vertigo, cardiac effects). Cite research studies.
- **Implant Interactions:** If device used in patients with implants, refer to ASTM F2503 (MR safety testing).

### For CT Device Submissions:
- **Dose is Always Reviewed:** Even if predicate has similar dose, provide ALARA justification and optimization strategies.
- **Iterative Reconstruction Claims:** Require clinical validation showing maintained diagnostic performance at reduced dose (≥50% reduction typical).
- **Spectral CT:** If dual-energy or photon-counting, validate material decomposition algorithms with phantoms.

### For AI/ML CAD Systems:
- **Reader Study Gold Standard:** Multi-reader multi-case (MRMC) study with ROC analysis is preferred for diagnostic AI.
- **Generalizability Evidence:** Test on external datasets from different institutions and scanner types.
- **Explainability for Trust:** Radiologists need to see what the AI is "looking at" - provide visual explanations.
- **PCCP for Adaptive AI:** If algorithm updates over time, FDA requires Predetermined Change Control Plan (2023 Guidance).

### For Ultrasound Devices:
- **MI/TI Display Mandatory:** Output Display Standard (ODS) per FDA 2019 Guidance.
- **HIFU Thermal Safety:** Requires tissue temperature mapping (MR thermometry) or validated thermal models.
- **Elastography Quantification:** If reporting shear wave speed or stiffness (kPa), validate with calibrated phantoms.

### For Nuclear Medicine:
- **Radiopharmaceutical Coordination:** Device submission separate from drug submission, but dose calculations must align.
- **Hybrid Imaging (PET/CT):** Address both PET performance (NEMA NU-2) and CT dose (21 CFR 1020).

### For Mammography:
- **MQSA Compliance:** Digital mammography must meet Mammography Quality Standards Act (21 CFR 900) beyond device clearance.
- **Dose Limits Stringent:** AGD ≤3 mGy per exposure is enforceable limit (not just guideline).
- **CAD for Screening:** High sensitivity required (≥95%) to avoid missing cancers. FDA carefully scrutinizes false negative rate.

### Use Case 1: 3T MRI System 510(k) Review

**Input:** User preparing 510(k) for 3T MRI system with advanced neuroimaging sequences. Requests SAR safety and image quality assessment.

**Output:**
```

- MAJOR: Acoustic noise exceeds 99 dB(A) recommended limit
- MINOR: ACR phantom results not included

Pre-Submission Readiness: 70/100 (SAR validation CRITICAL blocker)
```

### Use Case 2: CT with Iterative Reconstruction and Dose Reduction

**Input:** User submits CT scanner with iterative reconstruction claiming 60% dose reduction vs. predicate. FDA requests dose and image quality validation.

**Output:**
```
CT Dose Assessment (21 CFR 1020.33):
- CTDIvol (standard adult abdomen protocol):
  - Subject device: 8 mGy
  - Predicate device: 20 mGy
  - Dose reduction: 60% ✓ SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION
- ALARA justification: ADEQUATE - Iterative reconstruction algorithm reduces noise, enabling lower mA
- Dose reporting: CTDIvol and DLP displayed on console and in Dose SR IOD ✓ COMPLIANT
- Pediatric protocols: INCOMPLETE
  - CRITICAL: No pediatric dose protocols provided. Device labeled "all ages" requires validated pediatric protocols.

CT Image Quality Validation:
- CNR (5mm, 0.5% contrast object):
  - Subject device (8 mGy): CNR = 1.8
  - Predicate device (20 mGy with FBP): CNR = 3.5
  - CONCERN: CNR reduced by 49% despite manufacturer claim of "equivalent image quality"
- Low-contrast detectability:
  - Subject device: 6 out of 9 objects visible (3mm, 0.3% contrast)
  - Predicate device: 8 out of 9 objects visible
  - MAJOR GAP: Image quality degradation not assessed in clinical context
- Clinical validation: MISSING
  - CRITICAL: No reader study showing non-inferiority for diagnostic tasks (e.g., liver lesion detection)

Recommended Actions:
1. CRITICAL: Conduct multi-reader study showing iterative reconstruction at 8 mGy is non-inferior to FBP at 20 mGy for clinically relevant tasks (lesion detection, organ boundary delineation)
2. CRITICAL: Develop and validate pediatric dose protocols (0-1 yr, 1-5 yr, 5-10 yr, 10-15 yr age bands)
3. MAJOR: If reader study shows diagnostic inferiority, reduce dose reduction claim to level where non-inferiority is demonstrated (e.g., 40% instead of 60%)

Pre-Submission Readiness: 45/100 (Clinical validation CRITICAL blocker)
FDA Feedback Likelihood: HIGH - Dose reduction without clinical validation is common deficiency letter topic
```

- Per-nodule specificity: 82% (95% CI: 75-88%)
  - CONCERN: False positive rate 18% may lead to unnecessary follow-up imaging
- Free-response ROC (FROC) curve: MISSING
  - MAJOR: Provide FROC analysis showing lesion localization vs. false positives per scan

Subgroup Performance:
- NOT ASSESSED
  - CRITICAL: Stratify performance by:
    - Scanner manufacturer (GE vs. Siemens vs. Philips)
    - Slice thickness (0.625mm vs. 1.25mm vs. 2.5mm)
    - Patient demographics (age, sex, BMI)
  - Goal: No subgroup with sensitivity <80% or specificity <75%

Clinical Validation:
- Retrospective validation only - INSUFFICIENT
  - CRITICAL: Conduct multi-reader multi-case (MRMC) study:
    - ≥6 radiologists (mix of experience levels)
    - ≥200 cases (enriched with 25% positive rate)
    - Reader study design: Sequential read (unaided, then CAD-assisted)
    - Endpoint: CAD improves reader sensitivity by ≥5% without decreasing specificity
    - Statistical analysis: Jackknife FROC or Obuchowski-Rockette method

Explainability:

3. Conduct MRMC reader study: 4-6 months (including IRB approval, reader recruitment)
4. Complete IEC 62304 documentation and cybersecurity assessment: 2-3 months
Total: 10-15 months before submission-ready

Pre-Submission Readiness: 35/100 (Multiple CRITICAL gaps)
Recommendation: Pre-Submission meeting with FDA to discuss MRMC study design before initiating
