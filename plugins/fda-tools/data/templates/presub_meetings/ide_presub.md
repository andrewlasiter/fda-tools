**RE: Pre-Submission Meeting Request -- IDE Pathway -- {device_trade_name}**

Dear Reviewer:

{applicant_name} respectfully requests a **{meeting_type} Pre-Submission meeting** with FDA to discuss our planned clinical investigation of our {device_description_short} under an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE). We believe this device is classified under product code **{product_code}** (21 CFR {regulation_number}, Class {device_class}).

We are seeking FDA's feedback on our SR/NSR risk determination, proposed study protocol, and IDE application strategy:

{question_summary_list}

We propose a **{meeting_format}** meeting format at FDA's earliest convenience. Our clinical and regulatory team is available for a meeting within the next 60 days.

Sincerely,

## 4. SR/NSR Risk Determination

### 4.1 Risk Determination

**Our Determination:** [TODO: Significant Risk (SR) or Non-Significant Risk (NSR)]

### 4.2 Risk Determination Rationale

Per 21 CFR 812.3(m), a significant risk device is one that:
- Is intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk
- Is purported or represented to be for use in supporting or sustaining human life
- Is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease
- Otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject

**Our analysis:**

[TODO: Company-specific -- For each SR criterion above, explain whether your device meets or does not meet that criterion. Provide specific rationale.]

### 4.3 SR/NSR Decision Factors

| Factor | Assessment | Rationale |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Implanted? | [TODO: Yes/No] | [TODO] |
| Life-supporting/sustaining? | [TODO: Yes/No] | [TODO] |
| Substantial diagnostic/therapeutic importance? | [TODO: Yes/No] | [TODO] |
| Potential for serious risk? | [TODO: Yes/No] | [TODO] |
| Invasive? | [TODO: Yes/No/Partially] | [TODO] |
| Energy delivered to patient? | [TODO: Yes/No] | [TODO] |

### 4.4 Regulatory Requirements Based on Determination

**If SR Device:**
- Full IDE application to FDA required (21 CFR 812.20)
- FDA approval required before study initiation
- IRB approval required
- Informed consent per 21 CFR 50

**If NSR Device:**
- Abbreviated IDE requirements (21 CFR 812.2(b))
- IRB approval sufficient (no FDA IDE application needed)
- Informed consent per 21 CFR 50
- Must still comply with labeling, monitoring, and record-keeping
