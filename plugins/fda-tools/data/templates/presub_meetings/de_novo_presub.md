**RE: Pre-Submission Meeting Request -- De Novo Classification -- {device_trade_name}**

Dear Reviewer:

{applicant_name} respectfully requests a **{meeting_type} Pre-Submission meeting** with FDA to discuss the De Novo classification request for our {device_description_short}. We believe our device is a novel device type that does not have a legally marketed predicate device and should be classified as Class I or II through the De Novo pathway.

We are seeking FDA's feedback on our proposed classification, special controls, and risk assessment before finalizing our De Novo submission:

{question_summary_list}

We propose a **{meeting_format}** meeting format at FDA's earliest convenience. Our team is available for a meeting within the next 60 days.

Sincerely,

{contact_first_name} {contact_last_name}

## 4. De Novo Classification Justification

### 4.1 No Legally Marketed Predicate

We have conducted a thorough search of the FDA 510(k) database and have determined that no legally marketed predicate device exists for our device. Our search methodology included:

[TODO: Company-specific -- Detail predicate search methodology:
- Product codes searched
- Database searches performed (510(k), De Novo, PMA)
- Keyword searches and results
- Analysis of why identified devices are not appropriate predicates
- Documentation of search dates and databases]

### 4.2 Predicate Search Results

[TODO: Company-specific -- Document predicate search results]

| # | K/DEN/PMA Number | Device Name | Why Not a Predicate |
|---|-----------------|-------------|---------------------|
| 1 | [TODO] | [TODO] | [TODO: Different intended use / technology / etc.] |
| 2 | [TODO] | [TODO] | [TODO] |

### 4.3 Proposed Classification

**Proposed Device Class:** [TODO: Class I or Class II]

**Proposed Product Code:** {product_code} [TODO: or "New product code requested"]

**Proposed Regulation Number:** 21 CFR {regulation_number} [TODO: or "New regulation requested"]

**Classification Rationale:**

[TODO: Company-specific -- Explain why the device qualifies for Class I or II:
- Low-to-moderate risk device
- General controls (Class I) or general and special controls (Class II) are sufficient
- No need for PMA-level evidence]

## 6. Risk Assessment

### 6.1 Identified Risks

[TODO: Company-specific -- Comprehensive risk assessment per ISO 14971]

| # | Hazard | Risk Category | Severity | Probability | Risk Level |
|---|--------|---------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | [TODO] | [TODO] | [TODO] | [TODO] | [TODO] |
| 2 | [TODO] | [TODO] | [TODO] | [TODO] | [TODO] |
| 3 | [TODO] | [TODO] | [TODO] | [TODO] | [TODO] |

### 6.2 Risk Classification

**Overall Risk Level:** [TODO: Low or Moderate]

**Justification:** [TODO: Company-specific -- Why the overall risk profile supports Class I or II rather than Class III]

### 6.3 Benefit Analysis

[TODO: Company-specific -- Expected clinical benefits, unmet medical need addressed, improvement over current standard of care]

## 7. Proposed Special Controls

### 7.1 Special Controls Overview

[TODO: Company-specific -- List and describe each proposed special control]

We propose the following special controls for this device type:

**Special Control 1: Performance Testing**

- [TODO: Applicable standards]
- [TODO: Acceptance criteria]

**Special Control 2: Biocompatibility**
- [TODO: Specific biocompatibility requirements based on patient contact]
- [TODO: ISO 10993 endpoints required]

**Special Control 3: Labeling**
- [TODO: Specific labeling requirements to mitigate identified risks]
- [TODO: User training requirements]

**Special Control 4: Clinical Evidence**
- [TODO: Clinical data requirements, if any]
- [TODO: Post-market clinical follow-up requirements, if any]

[TODO: Company-specific -- Add or remove special controls as appropriate for device type]

### 7.2 Special Controls Justification

For each proposed special control, explain how it mitigates the identified risks:

| Risk | Special Control | Mitigation Mechanism |
|------|----------------|---------------------|
| [TODO: Risk 1] | [TODO: Control] | [TODO: How it mitigates] |
| [TODO: Risk 2] | [TODO: Control] | [TODO: How it mitigates] |

### 7.3 Special Controls Sufficiency
