**RE: Pre-Submission Meeting Request — {device_trade_name}**

Dear Reviewer:

{applicant_name} respectfully requests a **formal Pre-Submission meeting** with FDA to discuss the regulatory strategy for our {device_description_short}. We believe this device is classified under product code **{product_code}** (21 CFR {regulation_number}, Class {device_class}).

We are seeking FDA's feedback on the following topics prior to submitting a 510(k) premarket notification:

{question_summary_list}

We propose a **{meeting_format}** meeting format at FDA's earliest convenience. Our team is available for a meeting within the next 60 days and can accommodate FDA's scheduling preferences.

We have prepared detailed background information on our device, proposed predicate selection, and testing strategy to facilitate FDA's review and feedback during the meeting.

Sincerely,
