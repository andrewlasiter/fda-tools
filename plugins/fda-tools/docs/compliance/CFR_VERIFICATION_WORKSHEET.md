## Scope of Verification

### What is Being Verified (3 CFRs)

This worksheet verifies **regulatory framework CFRs** - the 3 CFR parts we cite to justify our data collection approach:

1. **21 CFR Part 803** - Justifies collecting MAUDE adverse event data
2. **21 CFR Part 7** - Justifies collecting recall data
3. **21 CFR Part 807** - Justifies collecting 510(k) clearance data

### What is NOT Being Verified

**Device-specific CFRs** (e.g., 21 CFR 870.1340, 21 CFR 888.3080) are **not verified** because:

- They come directly from FDA's own database (regulation_number field)
- FDA has already verified them as part of device classification
- We trust FDA's database values as authoritative
- They vary by device and are not static framework citations

**Verification Principle:** We verify OUR citations (framework CFRs), but trust FDA's own data (device-specific CFRs).

## Instructions for Verifying CFR Citations

1. Visit each CFR URL and verify it resolves correctly
2. Confirm the regulation title matches what is claimed
3. Verify the regulation applies to the stated use case (MAUDE/Recalls/510(k))
4. Check for recent amendments or effective date changes
5. Sign and date this worksheet upon completion

**IMPORTANT:** This verification must be performed by a qualified Regulatory Affairs professional. The verification confirms not only that URLs resolve and titles match, but also that the citations are appropriate and complete for the stated regulatory contexts.
