## Email Templates

### Template 1: Cold Outreach (Professional)

**Subject:** Quick favor: 60-min evaluation of 510(k) AI tool?

```
Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because of your background in [specific area from LinkedIn/profile].

We've built an AI plugin that helps medical device professionals with 510(k)
submissions - things like predicate research, substantial equivalence analysis,
and safety data review.

Before we go any further, we need honest feedback from people who actually do
this work. Would you be willing to spend 60 minutes evaluating whether this
tool is genuinely useful or just AI hype?

**What's involved:**
- Try solving a real scenario with and without the plugin
- Rate accuracy, time savings, and overall value
- Tell us what's broken and what's missing

**What you get:**
- Early access to the tool (free during beta)
- Direct line to our dev team for feature requests
- Your name in acknowledgments (optional)

**What we need:**
- 60 minutes of your time
- Brutally honest feedback
- Expertise in [their domain]

I can send you more details or schedule a call to discuss.

Would you be interested?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Title]
[Contact Info]

P.S. - We've already gotten feedback from [if you have any references].
Happy to connect you if you want to ask them about the process.

### Template 2: Warm Intro (via Referral)

**Subject:** [Mutual Contact] suggested I reach out

```
Hi [Name],

[Mutual Contact] mentioned you'd be a great person to talk to about evaluating
our FDA Tools plugin for medical device submissions.

**Quick context:**
We built an AI tool that automates parts of 510(k) work - predicate search,
SE comparison, safety analysis, etc. But we need validation from practitioners
like you before we can call it truly useful.

[Mutual Contact] participated in our evaluation last week and had some great
insights (they mentioned [specific feedback they gave]).

**The ask:**
Would you be willing to do a similar 60-minute evaluation? Same structure:
- Try a scenario with raw AI
- Try the same scenario with our plugin
- Rate what worked and what didn't

Your domain expertise in [their specialty] would be incredibly valuable,
especially for [specific aspect you want their input on].

I can work around your schedule - evenings and weekends are fine.

Interested?

Thanks,
[Your Name]

[Mutual Contact] can vouch for us if you want to check in with them first!
