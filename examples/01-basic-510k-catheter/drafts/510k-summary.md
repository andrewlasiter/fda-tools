## II. Device Name

**510(k) Device Name:** Example Percutaneous Catheter System
**Trade/Proprietary Name:** ExaCath-4

---

## III. Indications for Use

The ExaCath-4 Percutaneous Catheter System is intended for use in percutaneous
transluminal cardiovascular procedures to facilitate access and delivery of
interventional devices through the vasculature in adult and pediatric patients
(≥5 kg body weight).

**Conditions of Use:** Prescription use only (Rx). For single patient, single use only.

---

## IV. Description of Device

The ExaCath-4 is a 4 Fr single-use vascular access device consisting of:

1. **Delivery catheter** — braided polyurethane construction, 45 cm usable length,
   0.014-inch guidewire compatible, platinum-iridium radiopaque distal marker band
2. **Tuohy-Borst hemostasis valve** — with flush port and stopcock for blood backflow
   control during catheter advancement
3. **Self-sealing loader hemostasis valve** — allows device loading and flushing prior
   to deployment

The device is supplied sterile (EO) and non-pyrogenic. Shelf life: 36 months.

## V. Substantial Equivalence Summary

### Predicate Device

**K241335** — Amplatzer Piccolo Delivery System (St. Jude Medical, April 2024)

| Comparison Point | Subject Device (ExaCath-4) | Predicate (K241335) |
|-----------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Intended use | Percutaneous CV delivery | Percutaneous CV delivery |
| Product code | DQY | DQY |
| Regulation | 21 CFR 870.1250 | 21 CFR 870.1250 |
| French size | 4 Fr | 4 Fr |
| Sterilization | EO (ISO 11135) | EO |
| Single use | Yes | Yes |
| Biocompatibility standard | ISO 10993-1 | ISO 10993-1 |

**Conclusion:** The ExaCath-4 has the same intended use and equivalent technological
characteristics as K241335. Performance differences (braiding pattern, hub geometry)
do not raise new safety or effectiveness questions.
