## II. Device Name

**510(k) Device Name:** Antimicrobial Wound Dressing with Silver Sulfadiazine
**Trade/Proprietary Name:** HealGuard-Ag

---

## III. Indications for Use

HealGuard-Ag is intended for use as a primary wound dressing for the management of
partial and full-thickness wounds including burns (second degree), chronic wounds
(diabetic foot ulcers, pressure injuries), and donor sites. The silver sulfadiazine
drug component provides antimicrobial activity to reduce wound bioburden.

**OTC Directions:** Apply to clean wound. Change every 2–3 days or as directed by a
healthcare provider.

## IV. Description of Device

HealGuard-Ag is a device-led combination product consisting of three layers:

1. **Wound contact layer** — non-adherent polyurethane foam impregnated with 1%
   silver sulfadiazine (SSD) cream for direct wound contact
2. **Absorbent core** — polyurethane foam providing ≥15 g/10 cm² fluid absorption
   capacity per EN 13726-1
3. **Outer backing** — semi-occlusive polyurethane film with MVTR 800–1200 g/m²/24h;
   hypoallergenic acrylic adhesive border

**Sizes:** 10×10 cm, 15×15 cm, 20×20 cm
**Sterilization:** Gamma irradiation at ≥25 kGy (ISO 11137-1), SAL 10⁻⁶
**Shelf life:** 24 months

---

## V. Combination Product Designation

HealGuard-Ag is a combination product where the **device component provides the
primary mode of action** (physical wound management). The drug component (1% SSD)
provides antimicrobial activity secondary to the wound coverage function.

**Drug component regulatory basis:** OTC antimicrobial skin protectant monograph,
21 CFR 333 Subpart D. No separate NDA/ANDA required for OTC-monograph compliant
drug components in device-led combination products.

**Lead FDA center:** CDRH (device primary mode of action)

## VI. Substantial Equivalence Summary

### Predicate Device

**K243166** — Mepilex Border Ag Antimicrobial Foam Dressing (Molnlycke Health Care, August 2024)

| Comparison Point | HealGuard-Ag | Predicate (K243166) |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Intended use | Antimicrobial wound dressing | Antimicrobial wound dressing |
| Product code | FRO | FRO |
| Device class | U | U |
| Drug component | Silver sulfadiazine 1% | Silver-based antimicrobial |
| Drug compliance | 21 CFR 333 Subpart D | 21 CFR 333 Subpart D |
| Wound contact layer | PU foam | PU foam |
| Sterilization | Gamma, 25 kGy | Gamma |
| Absorbent construction | Multi-layer PU | Multi-layer PU |

**Conclusion:** HealGuard-Ag has the same intended use and equivalent technological
characteristics as K243166. Both are device-led combination products with silver-based
OTC-monograph antimicrobial drug components and polyurethane foam construction.
