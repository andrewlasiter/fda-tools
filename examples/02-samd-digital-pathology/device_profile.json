The software is not intended to replace pathologist interpretation and is intended as a decision-support tool only.",
  "device_description": "PathSight AI is a Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) that runs on validated hardware workstations (Windows 10/11, 64-bit, ≥32 GB RAM). The software includes: (1) a DICOM-compliant whole-slide image (WSI) viewer with pan/zoom/annotation tools; (2) a cloud-based AI inference engine (U-Net architecture, trained on 50,000 de-identified slides) that highlights ROIs for hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) stained tissue; (3) a case management module for pathologist workflow integration; and (4) an audit trail module for 21 CFR Part 11 compliance. The AI model outputs probability heat maps overlaid on the slide image; final diagnostic interpretation remains with the reviewing pathologist.",
