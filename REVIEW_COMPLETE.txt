RECOMMENDATIONS (BY PRIORITY)
=============================

PRIORITY 1 (CRITICAL - Do Immediately)
□ Fix git checkout syntax in lines 183-186
□ Add editor alternatives to line 163
Time: 6 minutes | Impact: High (enables rollback functionality)

PRIORITY 2 (HIGH - Do Within 1 Week)
□ Add quick reference error-to-section table at document start
□ Add 2 missing scenarios (presub plan without metadata, XML field mapping)
□ Improve JSON parsing in Scenario 7 (use Python not grep)
Time: 2-3 hours | Impact: Medium (covers 85% → 95% of issues)

PRIORITY 3 (MEDIUM - Do Within 1 Month)
□ Add concrete worked examples for 2-3 device types
□ Add plugin installation verification diagnostic
□ Strengthen 21 CFR 11 audit trail guidance
Time: 3-4 hours | Impact: Low (polish and enterprise features)

PRIORITY 4 (LOW - Future Release)
□ Add permission fix commands
□ Add platform-specific WSL2 considerations
Time: 1-2 hours | Impact: Minimal (nice-to-have)


QUICK REFERENCE: PRIORITY 1 CORRECTIONS
========================================

CORRECTION 1: Git Checkout Syntax (Lines 183-186)
Current:  git checkout HEAD~1 ~/fda-510k-data/projects/YOUR_PROJECT/presub_plan.md
Fixed:    cd ~/fda-510k-data/projects/YOUR_PROJECT/
          git checkout HEAD~1 -- presub_plan.md

CORRECTION 2: Editor Alternatives (Line 163)
Add options for: vim, sed -i, and Python-based programmatic editing
